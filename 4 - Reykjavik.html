<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">The Special Relationship</span></h3>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Evolutionary Change</span></h4>
<p>The success of my <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> team didn’t last. About a year after my new job started, we began to break up and drift apart. It wasn’t just us, either. The <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> scene was beginning to fade across Europe, as new games were released and old communities began to lose their collective enthusiasm. Some of the people from the team were already getting involved in other online games, such as the pseudomedieval wars of <span class="rend-i">Dark Age of Camelot</span> and the bite-sized World War II escapades of <span class="rend-i">Battlefield 1942.</span> Eventually we decided to end it.</p>
<p>Mildly despondent, I found solace in off-line games, work, and writing a terrible novel about sentient graffiti. I yearned for the camaraderie and the conflict that running the team had provided. And the void the team had left didn’t seem to fade or to be filled up with other projects. I began to dabble in other online games, but none of them really suited my method of play. The entire world seemed to be in the thrall of the team-based combat of <span class="rend-i">Counter-Strike,</span> with its counterterrorism theme and realistic weapons. But it just didn’t suit me. I no longer felt part of a community.</p>
<p>One of the games I began to experiment with during that time was called <span class="rend-i">EVE Online.</span> I loved the massively multiplayer concept it offered: thousands of people playing side by side in a vast, persistent galaxy. Trade, fight, build spaceships, and then fly them through the heavens—it was just the kind of gaming concept and fiction I could invest in. The only problem was that I didn’t really understand how it all worked. Grabbing a rocket launcher and defending a flag I understood. But trading on virtual markets, mining rocks, and fitting out fictional starships with a hundred different pieces of equipment? Well, that was too much for me. I soon gave up and looked for my fun elsewhere.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, I was back in <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> again, this time on the promise of a friend who was playing the game. He claimed that we’d be able to set up and run a mercenary company within the game world. We’d be bounty hunters, taking on contracts and hunting down villains for cash. It sounded thrilling. It became obvious quite soon that there was one crucial problem: we had no more idea how to become bounty hunters in this game than we did in real life. After a couple of months of floundering and aimless hours of exploring, we finally caught and killed our first miscreant. But he was also our last. I gave up on <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> and started playing other games.</p>
<p>And yet again, I was enticed back. My first two forays had imbued this game with a sense of mystery: how could a game be so complex that its workings were beyond my appraisal, even after weeks of play? What was it about this space game that made me return, despite the fact that I’d been so bored, frustrated, and perplexed? I began trying to answer some of these questions in an article. I discussed what it was that made this game unique, how it offered possibilities and choices rather than quests and stories. I began to see how it wasn’t “virtual” as such but, as Steven Shaviro describes cyberspace in his book <span class="rend-i">Connected,</span> “prosthetic.” <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> was an extension of what I was doing in my everyday life. It was hard work. Commitment.</p>
<p>Eventually it was also rewarding. I documented all this in my article “All about <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span>” which was eventually published in the popular U.K. magazine <span class="rend-i">PC Gamer.</span> A number of people who read the article wanted me to help them access the game, as I’d been helped by other members of its community. I found myself setting up an in-game corporation, hiring people I knew from Internet forums or from work, and helping them decide how to make the most out of the choices that this pretend galaxy offered them.</p>
<p>The psychic hole left by the end of my <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> years had been filled, without me even realizing it had happened. I’m still helping to run that <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> corporation today. I’m also still trying to figure out just what this strange game’s appeal is for me and to document the ways in which it has inspired gamers like me to do unexpected things. Part of that project of documentation meant traveling to where the game was conceived, designed, and created. And so I headed off to Reykjavik, the capital city of a tiny nation in the North Atlantic: Iceland.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.2"></a><h4>
<span class="rend-i">The</span> Star Wars <span class="rend-i">Machine</span>
</h4>
<p>Years of climate-destroying international travel have turned me into a connoisseur of Heathrow Airport’s long gray carpets. I’ve become familiar with each of the four terminals and now realize that each of them has a subtle and distinct flavor. Despite the uniform flooring materials and the themed sequence of corporate placards it shares with all the other buildings, Terminal 2 is a little more haphazard than the other flight-boarding structures. On a cold day in November 2006, it seemed altogether less organized—and perhaps less restrained and more relaxed—than the other terminals. None of the others, for example, had a <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> arcade cabinet of 1983 vintage resting halfway down the concourse.</p>
<p>The bulky, old-fashioned cabinet had been weathered by time, but it was nevertheless plugged in and functional. The game stood out like a beacon or a waypoint, and the fact that it rested next to the gate through which I was set to depart seemed auspicious. The cabinet was waiting there for a customer, silently, as it likely had done in other locations for the past twenty years. Wandering past the grubby TV screen, I suppressed my puppyish urge to rush over and pump the cabinet’s large plastic buttons. Instead I sat down to wait for the Icelandair flight to Reykjavik. From a distance, I watched the faint head-up display lines of an X-Wing plunge down a Death Star’s equatorial trench as the game played along by itself. The flickering display presented a simplified interpretation of the final space battle scenes of the first <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> movie; it was a sequence that must have played itself out on that screen many tens of thousands of times before.</p>
<p>Dotted between the roller-necked business travelers were dozens of young men wearing T-shirts emblazoned with twenty-first-century remixes of 1980s gaming icons. Some T-shirts displayed visual puns, images that combined jargonized witticisms, or jokes cobbled together from Internet neologisms. Others bore profane acronyms and absurd emoticons. Others still were deliberately outlandish: pink, lime green, furnished with the logo of the Bank of Alabama. By and large these travelers were an older generation of gamer, 20- or 30-somethings who were highly computer literate. Many of them no doubt harbored expansive knowledge of gaming ephemera and would almost certainly have seen the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine through my eyes. Eventually I noticed that one young man in an Atari T-shirt was watching the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine’s silent sequence. He leaned forward in his seat. Mentally I urged him to get up and play on the machine, since I was too embarrassed to do so. And eventually, to my surprise and joy, he did just that.</p>
<p>Video games make up a teeming mass of contemporary popular culture, of which past <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> games are now fading icons. Thousands of games have been produced since that <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> cabinet first appeared, but some of them, like the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> franchise in general, enjoy a peculiar social and cultural gravitas. The great games are the exceptions, milestones, iconoclasts, innovators—and the most important of them stand out as psychic landmarks for the gamers who played them. The name <span class="rend-i">Tempest</span> might sound Shakespearean to those who are unfamiliar with the 1980s electronic entertainment, but for many gamers—those who have been locked in its pixelated tunnels—it refers to a single, legendary arcade game that none of them is likely ever to forget. Like reading a great work of literature or becoming hooked on a particular wave of pop records, playing these masterwork games has defined our worldviews, filled out our vocabularies, and shaped our personalities. That <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine would, I knew, have featured prominently in the past of someone, somewhere—perhaps it even represented their first encounter with a video game.</p>
<p>I poured these thoughts into my notebook, each one seeming a little more plausible as I scribbled. For the past decade, I had been reading seemingly endless reports about gamers and the various fruits of their hyperactivity—a man killed for stealing an in-game item, a video game played on stage at a heavy metal concert, countless people meeting in games and falling in love. Games had turned into economies, political criticism, costume party cliques, and Hollywood films whose values were to be contested in a boxing match. (Uwe Boll, maker of terrible films based on video game licenses, fought some of his critics in a bizarre arranged duel in Vancouver.) My friends and colleagues filed reports of gaming obsessions from the Ukraine, China, Brazil, or California, all of them detailing the ideas and activities that games were generating, spontaneously, as in some vast, distributed conversation. And here I was, heading off to a volcanic landmass in the freezing North Atlantic to drink and eat and party, all for the sake of gaming.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Hypermodernized Viking</span></h4>
<p>Iceland is a beautiful raw place, burned into the North Atlantic by restless geology. On a bleak November afternoon, the clouds were low and the rain continuous, but the dead grass, gray skies, and empty black barrens of volcanic rock were nevertheless awesome. The taxi driver’s radio played a mix of peculiar honking and kitsch Icelandic sing-along tunes. It conjured images of men in knitted sweaters, middling keyboard players with a mission to inject pop into traditional Scandinavian music—a Scandinavian equivalent of the sad attempts to update, for example, American country music by mangling it into modern pop songs. My heart sank as I noticed the astronomical figure on the meter as we approached the outskirts of Reykjavik, a city in which there had been no trees until 1986.</p>
<p>Reykjavik has the characteristics of many coastal towns of the far north: windswept buildings built for the cold, often with corrugated materials and sharply sloped roofs. This hypermodernized Viking outpost also has one of the most advanced technology infrastructures on earth. It has the highest number of broadband Internet connections per capita of any OECD country, and its outlying winter landscape is punctuated by the glow of geoelectrically fueled sunlamps that feed vast, fruit-swollen greenhouses on the volcanic marches. Reykjavik is a midpoint between Europe and America, and its architecture, automobiles, and merchandise are an interesting mix of the two continents. Broad American cars, so incongruous in mainland Europe, inhabit the streets alongside familiar jelly-mold Fiats and Skodas.</p>
<p>Iceland also has a vibrant esoteric pop culture. One of its most famous exports is the singer-songwriter Bjork, whose singular voice and experimental attitudes have sold 15 million records worldwide. The tiny singer is a perfect ambassador for the island nation: exuberant, fierce, and unusual. The country’s other cultural exports are equally iconoclastic and remarkably unconstrained by the preconceptions that seem to burden cultural projects in other countries. The children’s TV show <span class="rend-i">LazyTown,</span> which is currently being shown in 98 countries worldwide, is produced in Icelandic studios using a mixed cast of American and Icelandic actors, CGI, and traditional artistry. The show is crammed with weird hyperactivity, melding a mix of real-world props with computer-generated environments and actors. A perfect example of Iceland’s topped-out tech level, <span class="rend-i">LazyTown</span> employs a large swathe of the most technically proficient designers and engineers in Reykjavik. It is also one of the most expensive children’s television series ever to be produced. Its immense popularity seems to depend as much on cash-fueled technological complexity as it does on the charm and energy of its star and creator, the fitness guru Magnús Scheving. The almost alarming zaniness of this half-hour show may seem to be an unlikely product of the long dark winters of Iceland, but it is suffused with the rich humor and outward-looking attitude that defines the national culture.</p>
<p>Another, equally offbeat product of the North Atlantic is the game that I was on my way to see. <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> is Iceland’s other hi-tech progeny: a critically lauded online world with its own full-time economist and a 200,000-strong population of gamers. Like Iceland itself, the game is an acquired taste and the preferred destination for a limited number of travelers. It, too, is bleakly beautiful and as technologically sophisticated as it is forbidding and cruel. It is a game that could only have been made here in this mid-Atlantic bubble, where certain rules do not seem to apply. It was a debut project that seemed completely uncowed by the considerable risks it was taking. CCP, the company behind <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> was unrelenting in the face of commercial pressures, they were also, like the Vikings, pioneering and perhaps even foolhardy. This game has been hugely controversial and has attracted a peculiar kind of commitment from its players—of which I am one particularly troubled example. I love this game, and I loathe it.</p>
<p>My first glimpse of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> happened after a magazine editor dismissed it as doomed. It was something that either would never be commercially released or would disappear into the gaming churn without a trace within a few months, just another overly optimistic project lost to bad luck and bad marketing—or so the editor predicted. But instead of vanishing, it consolidated, grew, expanded, and inspired. Reykjavik’s hi-tech baby had obsessed me for five years. Arriving at its home gave me a sense of energy that was inaccessible elsewhere. I was heading toward the source of a gaming project that had consumed a significant portion of my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.4"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Eighties Amoeba</span></h4>
<p>Later that afternoon, I crossed a second long gray carpet, this one in the hotel bar of the convention center hosting the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> festival. There on the refined flooring of the Nordica Hotel, I delivered my thoughts about the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine to one of Reykjavik’s 300,000 citizens. He sat staring off intently in a way that made me wonder whether he was really listening. But eventually he laughed. “The original Death Star run?” he asked, clearly incredulous. I nodded. “We should get one of those!” It was this man’s game I had come to Reykjavik to discuss. <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> is unlikely ever to retire to the corner of an airport lounge, precisely because its exploding starships exist in a networked place quite different from that of the old arcade machines: the Internet.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> seems a galaxy far, far away from the crude polygonal vectors of the 1983 <span class="rend-i">Star Wars.</span> It’s glistening spacecraft and dark nebulae transmit something utterly modern and uniquely imagined, though the evolutionary line that runs between it and the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine can still be quite clearly defined. If one were so inclined, it would be possible to map a genealogy of computer space combat, starting out in the 1960s with <span class="rend-i">Spacewar,</span> visiting <span class="rend-i">Space Invaders</span> at the end of the 1970s, and buying into the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> arcade game in the early 1980s. We might then see the idea expand geometrically through the space trading game <span class="rend-i">Elite</span> at the end of the Thatcher-Reagan era and evolve through <span class="rend-i">Elite</span>’s many imitators across the 1990s. (There are some weird sideshows as time goes on—such as the Hollywood-obsessed <span class="rend-i">Wing Commander</span> games.) Then, finally, as the millennium approached, the genre catalyzed into something new: the advent of accelerated graphics and the Internet brought us <span class="rend-i">EVE Online.</span> Here, at the end of our chronology, is the space game in its most sophisticated incarnation. Iceland’s most advanced product brings us up to date: this is twenty-first-century networked space war.</p>
<p>Games like the one in the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> box have been casting ripples through the gene pool of 20 years of accelerating technology. Although contemporary games might seem like multicellular monstrosities by comparison to these early amoeba of the 1980s, their basic makeup is the same<span class="rend-i">. EVE Online</span> is about flying a starship, blowing things up, and defeating your enemy—just like the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> game. In the Icelandic version, however, we play a game of starships and space stations with a concurrent population of up to 35,000 other people from across the world.</p>
<p>There had been similarly lavish-looking space games before, but <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> took things a step further by using the technology pioneered by games like <span class="rend-i">EverQuest</span> and <span class="rend-i">Ultima Online</span> to connect thousands of people to a single game world via the Internet. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s players shoot not only at computer-generated enemies but also at each other. They are free to fight or flee, to talk or trade; and unlike the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine, there is no one sequence that can be played over and over. It is continuous, changing, and fluid. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s population of 35,000 draws on a combined pool of 150,000 subscribers, each of whom pay $15 each month for constant access to the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> universe. This is far from our 20 minutes of five-a-side <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> combat, where the arena reset once victory was achieved. Instead <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is persistent, expansive, and evolving, with thousands of players competing and cooperating in an ongoing game.</p>
<p>Loading up <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> gives you access to a trio of spacefaring characters, a hangar full of spaceships, and a market economy in which only the most ruthless will become rich and famous. It’s a rich, dark world, with design reminiscent of David Lynch’s sci-fi movie <span class="rend-i">Dune.</span> You pilot your ship from a third-person perspective, guiding it between celestial waypoints, such as space stations and stargates. Drop-down menus reveal possible interactions—chat, shoot, orbit, approach. The game exudes a kind of deliberate functional indifference. Like an operating system for the heavens, it challenges you to learn how to use it. Knowing what the thousands of equipment items and hundreds of starships do is an education in itself. Learning which human pilots are your friends and which are betrayers is crucial. This is a game that does not offer objectives or easy goals, it simply offers itself: a dangerous, malevolent space in which to work.</p>
<p>These kinds of projects have been called “virtual worlds”—online 3-D spaces where our gaming alter egos can grow and be developed over time and where the world carries on even when the home computer is turned off. <span class="rend-i">EverQuest, World of Warcraft, Ultima Online, Second Life—</span>all these games have achieved fame and fortune via the virtual world idea. Compared to them, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is an obscure, unapproachable corner of the online scene, overshadowed utterly by the commercial successes of its peers. It is, however, also one of <span class="rend-i">the</span> important games, one of the landmarks I spoke of earlier. It is important not because of its (lack of) popularity but because it has enabled gamers to do things that they could not do before and cannot do anywhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.5"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Medieval Europe</span></h4>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE</span> enabled me to build up a team of people whose gaming talents and interests all complemented each other. Our efforts would persist within the game world and be written into its history. We would work hard to be an autonomous unit, so that even when we joined up with larger alliances of players, our little corporation would be able to look after itself: our talent as pilots has been something to be proud of. Our real achievements, however, were to be found in the name we made for ourselves and the reputation we earned with other players. A persistent character with genuinely valuable virtual inventory might be one reason why players feel attached to their time in <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> but it’s the social mesh that really hooked me. As in life, what has come to matter within the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> universe are our relationships with other people—how they feel toward us and whether we are to be trusted or feared.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s universe consists of a single cluster of computers. This network of machines is where <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s universe actually exists, and it is what gamers are accessing when they play the game. Unlike other online games, which usually host many different, cloned instances of their online world, <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> is a single virtual galaxy, hosted by a single group of machines. Much like the real galaxy, this one constitutes a work in progress. It changes, grows, and (perhaps unlike our galaxy) occasionally goes haywire.</p>
<p>Day-to-day progress is propelled by the game’s complex cash economy and the robust infrastructure that the players have built over time. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s in-game economy is equivalent to that of a small town, with the databases and market systems required to support the virtual businesses of its gamers. Its inhabitants make friends and enemies, fight, build, and make money. The marketing mythology surrounding <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> boasts that a demo of the game at an economic forum in Reykjavik had visiting American professors raving about the way it demonstrated their theories of microeconomics. Perhaps these professors asked their students to play the game so that they might better grasp the theories they were studying. If any of them did so, they would have discovered a remarkably feudal in-game social system, with players forming warring tribes and dealing with each other in a barbarous, violent manner—a space-bound medieval Europe. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s sophisticated virtual economy is fueled by one thing: war. Millions of transactions and interactions take place each day, each one seeking ways to support the huge military economies. CCP takes this economic complex so seriously that they’ve hired a full-time economist to deliver quarterly reports on the galactic economy—just as banks and governments do as they audit economic activities of real countries.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s endless conflicts give the game a kind of semifictional history. It’s “semifictional” because the gamers who play in it aren’t exactly acting, and the history they share results from real human interaction as much as it does from the background story developed by the game’s creators. The history of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is fashioned just as real history is fashioned—through the experience of real people. For every story of sci-fi conflict penned by a game designer, there are a hundred stories of gamers scamming other gamers or brave player-pilots winning battles against the odds. My own love for the game came not from the fictions that the game creators had crafted but from the stories I was able to tell of my own accomplishments: foes bested, alliances forged, spaceships produced.</p>
<p>These days, the job of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s creators is to burn new layers of detail into the galaxy through successive changes to the computer code that constitutes it. Gamers meanwhile get on with populating and using the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> world. They engage in war; exploration; economics; politics; trade; manufacturing; construction; and, occasionally, entertainment.</p>
<p>For all these reasons and more, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> has thrilled, frustrated, appalled, and delighted me. And it has, more than any previous game, focused and motivated me. By the end of 2006, I had given up numerous times, returning after a few months, when I was unable to find the same satisfaction in other games. I knew that if I was going to sink this much time into a game, I wanted it to count for something, for it to involve people I felt a connection with; I wanted to play with people who understood why I couldn’t give it up and who wanted more than just a series of interesting choices.</p>
<p>And so I had arrived from Heathrow along with five hundred other gamers and journalists. For identification purposes, many people wore T-shirts proclaiming their in-game allegiance. Others arrived in costume or wore outlandish goth uniforms—incongruous in the foyer of sandstone and faux marble. In shirt and cheap jeans, I remained anonymous.</p>
<p>The man I had been talking to at the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> event about my airport encounter with the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> machine was anonymous to no one. He was an event celebrity: Nathan Richardsson, the senior producer of <span class="rend-i">EVE Online.</span> And after listening to my story of the errant arcade machine, he got back to the subject at hand: changes to the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> system.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> does not (cannot) remain static, and it is Richardsson’s job to decide what must be changed. The bearded Icelander revealed that one of the game’s basic systems was to be radically altered in the next update of the world. It was a function of movement, something that had not, in all the years of the game’s life span, functioned as intended. Originally, celestial objects could not be flown to at warp speed and instead had to be approached from a distance. Now, with the latest change, you would arrive next to them. I was pleased to hear it would be fixed, but Richardsson seemed glum. Why? Even minor alterations were a difficult matter for him, and this one had clearly been agonized over at length. But there was nevertheless more to it than that.</p>
<p>The change had to do with the way players had learned to move their spaceships from place to place, and it was going to damage one of the possible player moneymaking activities. Players had discovered that they were able to use in-game monetary systems to sell the coordinates within space that allowed for safe traveling. Rather than warping to a celestial object and then trundling the last few miles, you could warp to a player-made coordinate that was already a few miles behind your target and thereby land on top of it. These spatial coordinates cold be sold as in-game files, and subsequently the bookmark makers were able to generate huge profits for their work. The players had worked this out without any help from the developers, and the system had not even been foreseen by the developers when the game had been put together. Players had figured out the best ways to transfer the coordinates, and the cash generated was adding to the thriving in-game economy. Sadly, however, the bookmarks had begun to affect the performance of the game, since they began to proliferate in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Of course, this was rather like a caretaker of the laws of a universe having to make a minor change that would directly interfere with its inhabitants—like God reaching down to make sure that train timetables were never invented. Richardsson lamented having to disable any activity that the players had come up with by themselves, especially one like this. It was one of the many “emergent” possibilities generated by the activities of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> players. And emergence was what made <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> worth playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.6"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Changing Rooms</span></h4>
<p>The concept of emergence is central to all kinds of gaming discussion. Even when it is not mentioned specifically, it is implicit in much of what gamers like to talk about. In its most basic sense, “emergence” refers to the way that a small set of rules can generate a highly complex set of consequences. <span class="rend-i">SimCity,</span> for example, presents us with a limited number of tools for building a city and a series of easy rules for using them. The uncontrollable explosion of events that result from the players’ road building and industry zoning nevertheless presents us with a complicated, emergent situation that requires serious struggle to master. In short, emergent games are ones that allow a huge range of possibilities and don’t dictate a strict, linear flow of events.</p>
<p>A strategy game is emergent because so many units can interact and have some effect on each other. There are so many possible interactions between individual game entities that the games can generate immensely complex, often surprising results. What is crucial about these results is that they become intelligible only through the act of actually playing the game. Gamers learn how a game functions by playing it—not by reading the manual or by hearing descriptions from other gamers. In fact, no one can say for sure how a game will work until it has been played by real people, no matter how well they understand the basic rules. Emergent games are said to be “computationally irreducible,” because the consequences of playing them cannot be deduced through any analytical shortcut. And that’s why commercial games are played so extensively by games testers in the final stages of development: the programmers might have had a perfect understanding of everything they did to make the system, but they cannot predict exactly how a game will be used. Understanding how the programming rules function can only be understood in the process of playing the game itself.</p>
<p>The activity of gaming is filled with examples of emergence in action. What I find even more fascinating, though, is the way in which emergent games inspire the emergent behavior of gamers themselves—the unique and peculiar things gamers will do with a game. As we’ll see, the emergent possibilities created by certain games have enabled gamers to undertake some unexpected projects. Situations that were unforeseen by game designers are routinely created by imaginative gaming, and it is these unintended consequences that I want to explore. I also want to see how, at least in the case of <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> some players deliberately set out to create new and unforeseen situations.</p>
<p>The American game designer Harvey Smith described one of the most famous examples of unexpected emergent behavior. Harvey’s example—the so-called proximity mine problem—grew out of his open-ended action shooter masterpiece <span class="rend-i">Deus Ex,</span> but it illustrates the kind of thing that gamers get up to on a routine basis: “Some clever players figured out that they could attach a proximity mine to the wall and hop up onto it (because it was physically solid and therefore became a small ledge, essentially). So then these players would attach a second mine a bit higher, hop up onto the prox mine, reach back and remove the first proximity mine, replace it higher on the wall, hop up one step higher, and then repeat, thus climbing any wall in the game, escaping our carefully predefined boundaries.” (“Escaping our carefully predefined boundaries” sounds like a slogan that should be on the T-shirts of traveling gamers.) Most gamers are familiar with similar kinds of stories. These kinds of situation are routine, especially in their online games modes, where gamers are able to work together to perform feats that were clearly not intended to be part of the game. Emergent behavior can take many forms, from action game players standing on each other’s heads to create exploding towers of people, to simply figuring out the best mode of cooperating to kill a tough opponent.</p>
<p>Moments before writing this paragraph, I was part of an online conversation with another game journalist, Quintin Smith. It was a typical exchange of gaming lore, and it left me with a snapshot of emergent fun as it happens in the wild. Smith had been playing an action game, <span class="rend-i">Thievery,</span> which is based around stealth and stealing. Players form opposing teams of thieves and guards and sneak and patrol against each other. The thieves, of course, must loot, while the guards are out to catch them. But it wasn’t the larcenous aims of the game that had made that evening’s play so entertaining; it was the interior decoration. “There were rudimentary physics and a lot of items scattered about,” said Smith. “One map had a huge manor that the thief side were meant to loot, but it also had a small bar in the corner. During one cooperative match, we began ignoring loot and collecting household furniture to turn the bar into a den. Medieval larceny became <span class="rend-i">Changing Rooms.</span>” (<span class="rend-i">Changing Rooms</span> is an inexplicably popular British TV program about household furnishing.) Smith’s thievery was at least temporarily forgotten because the game world had suddenly provided another possibility. The players had used the character’s in-game skills to creep about, dragging around furniture that was entirely incidental to the theft mission. Placing stools and tables, mugs and jugs, had become the new, unspecified goal of the game. Silly, yes, but the very fact that it was possible, unintended, and original to these players made it more amusing, more entertaining, than the game in hand. The experience might always have been about exploring, experimenting, and playing, but here were a bunch of players subverting the rules and conventions they were supposed to follow, in order to cook up a completely different way of being entertained. It happens all the time.</p>
<p>Smith’s anecdote about <span class="rend-i">Changing Rooms</span> demonstrates just how unpredictable the human element of a game really is. Of course, this kind of behavior is not peculiar to games; once people are given tools, they will always find new uses for them—it’s simply in our nature to improvise and invent as we play. There are, however, serious differences of opinion about what this kind of behavior means: is emergent play simply the passing enjoyment of novelty? Perhaps it is, but there are more complex examples—what might be called “emergent projects”—that suggest that emergence does something more for gamers than simply supply us with a few surprises. Some emergence involves less trivial goals, including the kinds of socioeconomic process that require years of careful cooperation and formidable willpower to accomplish. But I’ll come back to that in a few paragraphs’ time.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.7"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Asteroids</span></h4>
<p>Returning to Reykjavik and to Richardsson, it’s clear that he and his team have always expected their players to “break out of predefined boundaries.” Since its earliest days, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> has benefited from the seemingly endless inventiveness of gamers. In fact, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> was originally intended to be a game of economics and resources, complete with market information, trading tools, production facilities, and consumer items; but quite how all these elements would come together wasn’t immediately clear. The wealth of resources seemed bound to give rise to some kind of emergent behavior, since players would almost certainly find uses for them that the game creators had not foreseen. As in any other real-world economy, people would find novel ways of getting hold of cash, just because they could. (For example, a beggar I followed traveling from one solar system to the next would ask local pilots for the game equivalent of “just $10,000,” adding, “because I need to raise $100,000.” In reality, this was barely a few cents. Wealthy pilots would feel pity and cough up the $100K. The beggar then moved on to the next system… .) It was impossible for <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s designers to predict exactly what gamers might end up discovering, so complex were the possibilities they had created. However, for <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> to be interesting at all, it would require players to find interesting ways to behave. Fortunately they did just that from the outset, and in the early days, it was all to do with rocks.</p>
<p>One of the in-game resources that <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s players keenly exploit are asteroids, which can be “mined” for mineral reward. Of course, asteroids are just one of a number of resources that <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s creators provided at the outset. But what they hadn’t foreseen was the patience with which players would mine these space rocks or the way that the rocks enabled some players to become astronomically wealthy within just a few weeks of the game’s launch. What had happened was that the earliest adopters had discovered a loophole in the way the game worked, an unintended function of cargo canisters that made their mining unexpectedly efficient. While mining ships were supposed to travel back to base each time a cargo hold was filled, the player discovered that they could eject cargo cans next to their ship, thus increasing their storage capacity immensely and making the space rock easier to haul back at a later time. It had never been intended as such, but suddenly <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> was the game about farming space minerals. Players had once again climbed outside the predefined boundaries, and in a matter of days, they had transformed <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> from role-playing action game to a space-mining management simulation. It is a reputation the game has never quite managed to shrug off.</p>
<p>Asteroid harvesting was only ever intended to have niche appeal, and its initial popularity was entirely unanticipated by <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s creators. But although the game’s focus soon returned to shooting, the mining bug never went away. In fact, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s design team was delighted by it: mining meant cooperation. Players would have to work together to get rich. Instead of designers erasing the loophole and forcing players to get on with shooting each other or trading in consumer goods, this new way of mining was written into the game and further facilitated in later iterations of the game code. By working out how to “break” the game, players had changed its direction forever. It was as if Smith’s in-game furnishing had been extrapolated into a subgame of interior decoration, with the game’s creators providing the option for wallpaper and a comfy sofa.</p>
<p>Reactions to player behavior were to shape much of the overall direction of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> in the years that followed. Although the game’s creators could predict how many of the more mechanical elements of the game would work, the human side had to be studied in the field. The team had always intended players to fight each other for control of territory, as they did from day one, but even as I write these words, the problem of turning territorial conflict into a functional gaming system has not been resolved. The things that made <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> such an appealing game also made it into an intractable design problem: how far could they let players go, and could anyone ever actually be allowed to “win”? How do you create a game that functions at once as a battleground, à la <span class="rend-i">Star Wars,</span> and a satisfying outing for a couple of friends wanting to explore the galaxy? These are ongoing problems for a small army of game designers.</p>
<p>The programmers, meanwhile, are busy providing tools that allow better man management, so that people can organize groups of tens, hundreds, or thousands of other players. They’ve even managed to implement contract systems that allow players to earn trust in a financial world where there is no genuine liability for one’s actions. All of this represents unprecedented terrain for gaming, and yet still the game is awkward, unfinished, unresolved. We can get on with the business of playing, enjoying the combat, trade, and exploration, but it’s always going to change. It has to change and has been doing so for over three years. And still hard problems remain: how much freedom can you give to 150,000 players? How do you balance the power of hundreds and thousands of people in a single game? “We’ve got a lot of work still to do,” says Richardsson, a man who knows that <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is more an ongoing experiment in game design than the definitive space war.</p>
<p>By “we,” Richardsson might of course have been referring to the players as well as the designers. As much as the team of programmers and artists create, it’s ultimately down to the gamers to play and play. The game slowly changes in light of what they achieve. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is their work in progress as much as it is a decadelong quest for its creators. This unusual relationship will likely continue until all the players leave and the stars shut down. These people need each other, symbiotically. It is not even as if the game could now be mothballed and then revived and dusted off at a later date. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is alive because of how players bought into it and how creators worked on it from day to day. Picking up <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> isn’t like picking up the Game Boy you bought ten years ago for a quick burst of <span class="rend-i">Tetris.</span> You log out of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> knowing it won’t be the same when you return. <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> more than any other game out there, is an event.</p>
<p>Such player activities as selling the travel coordinates might have broken Richardsson’s game by overloading the coordinate-handling server, but coming up with them in the first place was the whole point of what CCP was trying to achieve. They wanted to make their model so open-ended that people had to figure out their own solutions for problems. Buying and loading coordinates drew you into the emergent aspects of the game—without them, you were a second-rate pilot. Such exploratory behavior was utterly vital to the success of <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> and without it, there would have been an enormous amount of stagnation. Instead of having to be a director waving a magic wand that orchestrated every nuance of every experience within the game universe, Richardsson and his team could rely on gamers to make their own progress and their own entertainment.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">EVE</span> players can contribute in all kinds of ways. They can contribute through politics, wars, trade agreements, and mutual pacts. They create wars and peace accords. They find new ways to use what the game has given them and to generate activities that were unforeseen by anyone else. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> pilots organize their own entertainment: several spaceship races, for example. These were impromptu solar system rallies, where various speeding ships were able to compete for prizes by rigging their ships for speed and then hurtling through the void. Other players used the monetary systems to organize lotteries of virtual cash. Events like these were entirely unscripted and unsupported by the designers. All Richardsson and his team had needed to do was build the framework, then, like gods sitting back to watch their pocket universe, they could watch it perform. There are gamers who run Internet radio stations broadcasting music, news, and sometimes “travel reports” based on dangers reported within the game world. Perhaps most impressive of all are the players who worked out how to develop games-within-games for <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s in-game browser. This simple tool for viewing Web pages had been included to allow gamers to create out-of-game Web sites for their corporations and alliances, but it was soon put to other uses. By figuring out how to make this in-game browser (which cannot browse normal Web pages) host an online poker tournament or multiplayer <span class="rend-i">Connect Four,</span> enterprising <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> players had given the general population of players something else to do in-game, ensuring that they weren’t going to get bored while they were gnawing at space rocks.</p>
<p>There have been darker ramifications, too. Scamming has been rife, with the largest player-run “investment opportunity” turning out to be a fairly sophisticated pyramid scheme, with large dividends paid back using subsequent investments. The organizer claimed to have run off with the virtual equivalent of around $100,000. It was all legitimate, said the developers. You have to be smart to survive. Other gamers were banned for “exploits” that were abuses of the many loopholes the programmers had been unable to foresee or fix.</p>
<p>These remarkably lifelike possibilities arise from the rules of the game but are also born of the creativity and ingenuity of gamers. We are so keen to find ways of keeping <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> fresh and challenging that the game necessarily develops in unforeseen directions. When a game environment is as complex as this, it becomes increasingly likely that unpredictable circumstances will emerge. We want them to emerge, and we make it happen. And yet all this takes place within the boundaries of what we recognize as a game. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is not some simulatory oddity, an operating system, or a 3-D building program. It is a vast universe populated by computer-controlled enemies, space stations, weird mutant drone machines, hidden asteroid belts, and human players in ships of various kinds. It is not a game in which mastery with a gun will ensure victory—because you could well be facing multiple opponents equipped with a menagerie of exotic weaponry. These endless possibilities for equipping a spaceship mean that although the basis of the game is modeled on the classic “rock, paper, scissors” design, there’s always the potential for an unexpected kind of rock to appear. Most important of all, there’s the potential for enemies to devise ingenious plans to use against you and for you to foil them in turn. The ability to communicate is just as important as the ability to wield a giant laser cannon.</p>
<p>Although the simplest games remain, in many ways, the most joyous, it seems to me that what gamers get from them is also simple. For more sophisticated rewards, we find ourselves demanding more sophisticated challenges. Games now have an option to become more and more complex and to utilize not only the computational power of modern gaming tech but also the communicative power of the Net. They can employ the enthusiasm of gamers to make something greater than the sum of their programming, through social gaming. When gamers combine their efforts in team gaming or their creativity in building within game worlds, they build on the foundations provided for them by the original game design. Occasionally, when games designers grasp the idea of providing new in-game tools for gamers to use, new possibilities for emergent behavior appear. This is what makes games such exciting and unpredictable things to be involved in: I log on to <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> knowing I can fly around and blow up spaceships, as I’ve been able to do in other games for over 30 years, but I also know that other things will emerge from the nebulae, other possibilities. The changes to <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> that Richardsson was telling me about in the bar of the Nordica Hotel lounge were to some extent putting a limit on those possibilities. That, I suspect, was the reason he was looking glum.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.8"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Serenity Steele</span></h4>
<p>Later that night, however, Richardsson was far from glum: he was partying. Five hundred players (mostly young men, but with an incongruous contingent of girls in boots) had arrived in Reykjavik for three days of drinking, lectures, and general socializing. The gamers attended seminars on various aspects of <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> and debated things with <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> developers. Others played a card game derived from the video game, while still others participated in a tournament where various pilots engaged their ships against each other. Almost all of them drank beer.</p>
<p> One of these partygoers was an energetic young Dutchman in horn-rimmed glasses. He bustled up to our table to show off a prototype of a book of strategic maps based on the star systems in the game. He hoped that the development team might help him to bring the book to the market. I leafed through it; this was a proficient-looking tome, filled with detailed information on the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> universe. The energetic man’s real name, I later discovered, was Shayne Smart, but that wasn’t how he was introduced to me. This was Serenity Steele, from Interstellar Starbase Syndicate (henceforth ISS), a name familiar to most <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> players. Steele, Smart’s in-game persona, is one of the figureheads of the most aggressive and deliberate project to have emerged within a game. The ISS is a unique attempt to develop the idea of emergent behaviors based on the tools and ideas found in <span class="rend-i">EVE Online.</span></p>
<p>Smart and his Danish gaming partner Martin Wiinholt wanted to bring a more neutral, modern infrastructure to the game world. While most of the game defaulted to feudalistic, warring tribes of players, the ISS project was designed to be something rather more capitalistic. Smart and Wiinholt intended to invent their own objectives and to bend the game to their own vision. They were not simply going to ply the markets for a quick virtual buck; nor were they going to get together a gang of ships to make friends and explode enemies. They wanted, instead, to create an alternative infrastructure. They understood that the real world was not dominated by tribes and armies; it was banks, captains of industry, and administrative organizations who had the real power. With their sci-fi alter egos already having made an in-game fortune, the pair launched a project that was “part role play, part game play” and declared themselves to be neutral to all parties. The two gamers announced their intention to add to the game world in a way that could be useful to all players, regardless of which faction they had aligned themselves with. This would be a project for everyone, not just warmongers.</p>
<p>The first ISS project was to build in-game space stations. Nothing strange there—plenty of other large player conglomerations had intended to build stations, too. But the ISS plan was to sell theirs as public projects. Their stations would not be private fortresses but shared, public outlets, paid for by shareholders. They would be neutral zones, forums for trade, solaces for the persecuted and the poor. The money to build these space stations (astronomical, even in a game as awash in virtual capital as <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>) would be raised by selling shares in the project, and shareholders would benefit from dividends paid for by the profits made by the station. To provide a sense of perspective on this, it’s worth considering that the first <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> space station took perhaps 200 people many thousands of man-hours to prepare and was valued at around US$8,000 at the initial public offering, calculated on the basis of eBay rates for <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s virtual cash at the time.</p>
<p>Crucially, Smart and Wiinholt wanted to create an entity within the game that would allow players to make the most out of their time. If you wanted to contribute to a larger project or simply to have access to a neutral base in dangerous, profitable “Wild West” areas of the galaxy, then the ISS project would work for you. And in the process of making the ISS work, Smart and Wiinholt would create an unparalleled social experiment. What the game’s developers couldn’t create in terms of climate, cooperation, and mediation, the ISS would attempt to do. There was no way to enforce neutrality in a game of pure warfare, and that meant the ISS would have to depend on social and political maneuvering to allow their plans to work. They would have to depend on the respect of the players to let their intentions survive intact. One of the earliest tactics adopted by the syndicate was to offer shares to the local pirate groups who would most likely cause trouble, with the expectation that getting them inside the project, getting them involved, would direct their troublemaking elsewhere. Of course, their in-game finances meant that the ISS could also afford the best mercenaries to protect the project, but the investment, the project itself, would depend on gamers understanding that the ISS was a deliberate attempt to furnish a game world with new ideas and new principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.9"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Gamer’s Reverie</span></h4>
<p>The initial elements of the ISS’s social and political work were to be found in the business plans delivered by Smart and Wiinholt on the ISS Web site. Drawn up the way one might draw up a plan for investors in a real-world scenario, the ISS business profile outlined how the shareholder space station project would pay for itself. It told investors where the money would go and how shareholders could be expected to make a profit. The ISS masterminds’ businesslike approach was to be reflected in all aspects of the overall project, with regular reports on the game’s forums and far-reaching plans to rejuvenate “backwater” areas of space by building a chain of stations where none had previously existed. I was one of many gamers who bought into the project. My <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> friends had found themselves uprooted, thanks to wars not going our way, and soon we installed ourselves in an ISS station. We all poured money into the ISS project, and we were alternately delighted or bemused by the tiny dividends that were paid back to us by Smart and Wiinholt’s online team.</p>
<p>A year later, this station-building project came to an end. It seems that Wiinholt and Smart could only sustain neutrality for so long, and the propensity of gamers to just want to blow things up led to wars, arguments, and, ultimately, the loss of the publicly funded stations to privately held <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> corporations. And so the ISS project has also moved on. Smart and Wiinholt are now attempting something even more ambitious: to drive their virtual business forward by selling off the entire ISS corporation to shareholders. This means that an organization run by hundreds of individual players will be responsible to its shareholders. The intention to sell shares in the corporation itself means that, for the first time ever, an in-game organization will be publicly owned by people other than its own players. It will be financed by the wider population of <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> so that it can buy new assets, trade, manufacture, and pay back its investors accordingly. According to Smart and Wiinholt, the corporation will be motivated exclusively by the need to deliver shareholder value. The money it raises will be invested in trade and used to generate more cash by manipulating <span class="rend-i">EVE’s</span> complex economic systems. The hundreds of gamers who play under the ISS banner will be responsible to other gamers for their virtual cash. Since <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s virtual currency can be bought and sold in online markets, such as eBay, it’s possible to make a valuation of the corporation: a conservative estimate puts the value of the ISS at $75,000, although it could really be as much as $150,000. And this does not include the considerable personal assets of the ISS membership.</p>
<p>Smart told me that the ISS idea originally developed from “a personal desire for emergent play.” This is no accidental happenstance dreamed up in a gamer’s reverie: it is a deliberate, grand project and will represent a lifetime achievement not just for Wiinholt and Smart but also for many of the other gamers who have sunk months of their own time into making the ISS idea into a (virtual) reality. What makes ISS so exciting for these gamers is that it says something about how they might be able to work together in games in the future. As in the case of the ISS, there’s the possibility of devising your own content and delivering it to the game. There’s the chance to leave a mark, to affect the game directly and change the experience for thousands of other gamers.</p>
<p>Games have always looked to the future, and they have also always been exercises in imagination: we can’t help thinking about what else might be possible. This phenomenon seems to me to be peculiarly pronounced within the medium of electronic games. We don’t tend to imagine possibilities for future books with such clarity or to imagine “What if … ?” when we watch a good movie. But games instill gamers with a particular desire for and vision of future experiences. They see one game and instinctively extend it into other, imagined experiences. All gamers have discovered something they didn’t expect in a game and wondered what it would be like if other games offered the same kinds of possibility. The ISS project asked “What if … ?” for the entire future of online worlds.</p>
<p>Smart and Wiinholt imagined what was possible within <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> and then gained the confidence and trust of other gamers necessary to make it so. They persuaded many players to respect their ambitions and to sign on to the project. They encouraged people to part with vast amounts of virtual money that they had spent months of game time accruing. The ISS idea was far more than a bit of acting and playing: it was a wealth of in-game content, complete with personal quests, bitter feuds, and profound commitments. Additionally, it was something that only the players themselves were capable of in the context of that particular game. The developers would not have had the manpower to organize it, even if they had thought of it. The players who understood what the ISS project was and how it worked now look at other games and wonder when that kind of potential is going to be available to them again. In that way, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> provides a model for the possible future of games.</p>
<p>The role of user-generated content in online gaming is becoming increasingly significant. Sure, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> might be a hard-core, relatively nerdy space game, but it also delivers examples of systems that can be imitated by other games: resources, economics, communications. These are tools that allow players to set themselves goals way beyond high scores and bragging rights. Smart and Wiinholt might have been guided by <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s sci-fi premises and at once hindered and aided by the warring players, but what’s most important is the emergent potential they detected in the game that inspired them. A couple of gamers used their organizational and imaginative skills to make the most of an opportunity to create something far above and beyond the service they had signed up to for 15 bucks a month.</p>

<a name="4.1.10"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Unusual Agendas</span></h4>
<p>Let’s take a step back for a moment and examine the significance of what Smart and Wiinholt have been up to in a little more detail. Consider for a moment that only certain elements of the expansive worlds that games offer are actually working parts of the games. Wandering through <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft,</span> you know to talk to the person with the yellow exclamation mark overhead, even though the world seems to be alive with flora, fauna, and wandering elves. No matter how complex a game seems to be, it still follows certain rules. In <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> you know that the space stations and spacecraft are there to be interacted with, while the stars and planets are not. The market defines how well your business ideas will work, while the modules you equip a ship with will define its abilities and limitations. This is not a complete and limitless galaxy, it is a game. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> remains tightly bound to its aim of creating tales of space combat and economics. This isn’t total freedom: there are strict parameters and obvious limitations. The game’s creators might aim to create tools for players to go off and make their own fun, but the kind of tools they provide will end up defining what that fun is. The ISS project benefited from the open-ended nature of the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> world, where players are able to build infrastructure and then exploit resources. But the players did not create that framework; they simply innovated within it. Smart and Wiinholt defined their goals based on how money could be transferred and how the construction of space stations had been implemented. This, in turn, defined the goals they were to create for other players, all in the context of a sci-fi space war. Ultimately, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s space war genetics mean that it still adheres to some old-fashioned ideas about how games should function: players create “kill boards” to list who they’ve defeated, while total skill points and measures of wealth provide traditional aspirational targets for gamers to aim for. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s emergent projects are clever, unforeseen, and often complex, but they also come laden with video game baggage.</p>
<p>Other games provide even more room for players to build, and they discard much of what has traditionally characterized the experience of game playing. These are games in which the process of creating things and toying with the game world is more important than achieving a high score or completing a quest. In fact, in some cases, all such targets have been rejected to create something that has no goals attached. These are less like games than like toys or, perhaps, tool kits.</p>
<p>These systems are occasionally referred to as “sandbox games.” <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> has some elements of a sandbox, but goals and quests are still quite carefully delineated for the players. Similarly sandboxlike are the <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto</span> games, which allow you to pursue vehicular mayhem for it’s own sake, going crazy in the city without any reference to the missions that the game has on offer. For an example of something even more open-ended, it’s worth taking a look at the absurd <span class="rend-i">Garry’s Mod,</span> which is a sandbox experience where players are able to build Rube Goldberg contraptions, robots, and roller coasters from a wealth of tools and physics options that have been bolted on to the original game of <span class="rend-i">Half-Life 2.</span> There are few constraints, and there is no game as such. <span class="rend-i">Garry’s Mod</span> is a wild, demented playground, often hosted online in the same way that <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> servers are, so that people can jump in and build a jet-propelled bed or a catapult for launching zombies. Players aren’t logging on to <span class="rend-i">Garry’s Mod</span> servers to play rounds of capture the flag or to work on their combat skills; instead, they log on to invent inertia tricks that lob trucks through the sky or to build spinning silos covered in gelatinous whips.</p>
<p>The most famous sandbox game of all is called <span class="rend-i">Second Life.</span> It is an online 3-D world in which gamers can create all kinds of functional objects—from houses to bicycles, jet packs to robot suits—using the tools provided for them. Like <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> it is a single world, which people can log into and move around in at will. There are few constraints, which has led to numerous problems: players are quick to create weird 3-D pornography or to crash a server by generating an infinite number of polygonal penises. Give gamers an inch of rope … But thanks to <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> jettisoning much of its gaming heritage, it has become something more like a communal operating system than a game. It’s a 3-D building system, like a CAD engine, in which people chat, trade, socialize, and pursue various unusual agendas. Building, shopping, and socializing are ends in themselves for the citizens of <span class="rend-i">Second Life.</span> The world’s users are asked to come up with their own functions for the system it provides, and there is nothing to play, although people can and do make their own games to play within the world. Much has been made of the significance of <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span>’s open-ended freedoms. There have even been some excellent books written about how to run an in-game business or what the economics of <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> mean for real economies. In fact, the commentary on <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> is so dense, so hyperbolic, that it’s easy to lose sight of the significance of other games in the lives of gamers.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been reading through mainstream games coverage during the past couple of years might very well be surprised to learn that there are any important online games besides <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> and <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft.</span> In many cases, writers have found something interesting to write about—say, the socioeconomic ramifications of <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span>—but they have also, in my opinion, ended up delivering a skewed image of what the real significance of the <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> project is. I use it, for example, as a meeting room or, sometimes, as a kind of safari. Wandering through a landscape of unfinished projects and cyberpunk lounges can be an enchanting, if occasionally intimidating, experience. If you haven’t already, you should take a look for yourself. If you have an Internet-enabled PC, go to secondlife.com. It’s completely free (at the time of writing) to sign up and explore.</p>
<p>As fascinating as <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> has been to watch and explore and despite the hype, I do not believe that it is making gamers in the way that the past couple of decades of video games has done. <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> is certainly an interesting 3-D Web application, but the experiences it contains are necessarily equatable with the experience of playing more traditional games. The effect it has, therefore, is quite different. Furthermore, and most important for the purposes of the present analysis, I do not believe gamers are the people who are influencing the application’s future direction. <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> has emerged from events and developments within gaming technology, but it represents the extreme end of a trend toward sandbox games. This trend poses some tough questions about how best to describe what these things are, what they do, and what they are for. If the connotations of the word <span class="rend-i">games</span> are in some way misleading, as some people have argued, then what sort of territory are we wandering into here? And what of the halfway houses like <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> where so much is possible and where the ideals of gaming also remain so rigidly defined?</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.1.11"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Use Models</span></h4>
<p>Games are storytelling, cinema, music, and technology, but they are also part person. They work only when we are working with them, and they require the active participation of a gamer to accomplish anything at all. <span class="rend-i">SimCity</span> inventor and prognosticator Will Wright observed that unless you actually play games, it’s hard to judge what is happening to a gamer: “Watching someone play a game is a different experience than actually holding the controller and playing it yourself. Vastly different. Imagine that all you knew about movies was gleaned through observing the audience in a theatre—but that you had never watched a film. You would conclude that movies induce lethargy and junk food binges. That may be true, but you’re missing the big picture” (<span class="rend-i">Wired,</span> April 2006). To understand games, we have to be able to usefully describe how gamers themselves interact with them.</p>
<p>One way to describe games is to say that they are models. Thinking of video games as working models provides us with a useful perspective on how they work and what gaming is. Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby outline this idea in the introduction to their book <span class="rend-i">Smartbomb,</span> where they liken the cognitive processes required to play games to those required to understand other operational models, like orreries—the archaic devices constructed by astronomers to represent the position and motion of the heavens. “Traditional media like books and movies use descriptions (linguistic, visual, etc.) as a means of representing and communicating ideas,” say the <span class="rend-i">Smartbomb</span> authors. “Video games use models.”</p>
<p>The orrery of Ruby and Chaplin’s example is a device used to model something real—the relative positions of celestial objects—but games aren’t similarly constrained. Instead, they model things born of imagination: the 2-D adventures of a dolphin or the tale of a terrifying galactic war. Games model what it might be like to fly a hang glider, fight your way out of a military research facility overrun by aliens, or fit together falling blocks so that they might annihilate each other. They can model third-person tennis, volleyball, or bowling; or they can model the management of conflicts between armies, as seen by you, the omniscient general in the sky. Games model a tiny plumber fighting against a tide of penguins that will inevitably push him into the sea or a flying boy collecting clouds in the sky. Games model burglary and submarine combat. They model living in a house and wanting to date the girl across the street. They model people, processes, ideas, and actions. In fact, the modeling possibilities for games are effectively infinite, since what they model is intended not to educate but to entertain. Their models don’t have to be accurate to anything outside themselves, although they usually have to be coherent. The models of video games are the models of fantasies, or models designed to indulge our sensuality—streams of colors and noise where what is modeled isn’t important, only how the nervous system reacts when engaging with it. Video games are a new kind of model, not intended to be tweaked and studied like the orrery or the architect’s 3-D plan, but meant to be manipulated for pleasure and intellectual stimulation. War games are models of war in the same way that a kids’ action figure is a model of a soldier: they might teach you nothing about soldiering, but the process—the flash of the gun and the tension of the battle—conveys enough to keep us interested and stimulated.</p>
<p>The idea that video games are models that require a person to complete them could also lead us to think of them as models in another sense. This alternative description was, again, best formulated by gaming polymath Will Wright, who, as well as having created some of the best-selling games of all time, has turned out to be a man with an uncanny ability to describe things in ways that have eluded other people. In June 2006, during a public conversation with the musician Brian Eno, Wright explained: “When we do these computer models, those aren’t the real models; the real models are in the gamer’s head. The computer game is just a compiler for that mental model in the player. We have this ability as humans to build these fairly elaborate models in our imaginations, and the process of play is the process of pushing against reality, building a model, refining a model by looking at the results of looking at interacting with things.” This idea echoes what I have already said (earlier in this study) about learning to play games—that it is to some degree comparable to the scientific method. It also suggests something about how games are experienced as unfinished or incomplete. Games, as created objects, are seldom “finished” in the ways that books or paintings are finished. You read a book from beginning to end, and the words arrive in the same order, no matter your particular interpretation of the text. The same is not true of games, where the sequences of events for any given player is likely to be quite different. Even if their creators do no further programming to refine the game, it is still a working thing, a working model, with dynamic actions taking place within. As you race around <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</span> in stolen vehicles, your route, your crashes, your fights with police will all be slightly different from those of any other player.</p>
<p>This is a vitally important point: that a game cannot function without active and continued participation from a human being. It is a model because it is also a mental model, and that mental model is never complete, is always a changing, working instance. As you play, you will think about the goals a game has set for you. In the depths of <span class="rend-i">Zelda</span> adventure, for example, what is important is the way you explore the possibilities of the world. The ways that the goals, story, and characters have defined your objectives and provided you with tools to meet them combine to create your experience of a game: the mental model you create for thinking about the game and solving its problems. Consciously and unconsciously, you keep the game moving by wrestling with your personal model of its goings-on. Your personal impression of the game is the model you use for dealing with it.</p>
<p>This, in turn, suggests something about how games are made. Through the lens of Wright’s description, we can see that games are initially rudimentary models in the minds of their creators, imaginative models that go on to be turned into computer models, which are then refined and reiterated until, finally, they constitute an instance of a game that can be used to create imaginative models in the minds of a player. The mental models within players come about while playing, and this is a private experience, unique to the gamer and game.</p>
<p>The Internet is, however, changing this process. Games are increasingly becoming collaborative enterprises, with many people working together to achieve a range of experiences between them. (The game <span class="rend-i">A Tale in the Desert,</span> for example, is about the construction of a civilization in ancient Egypt. A lone <span class="rend-i">Tale in the Desert</span> player can achieve little and instead must collaborate with dozens of others to build temples, statues, and pyramids.) The mental models created by online games are not limited to the minds of one or two participating players but involve the minds of thousands. <span class="rend-i">EVE Online,</span> for example, is a vast model that is manipulated and observed by tens of thousands of people simultaneously. All these people have their own impressions of what they’re interacting with, and many of them will offer their differing opinions, influencing the perceptions other players and the game developers as they do so. The model of precisely what is being played will be different from player to player, and the meaning of the experience itself is ambiguous to outsiders.</p>
<p>The creators of this new generation of games do not have to be satisfied with a single instance of their creation: they can now continue to develop and alter these games by releasing changes over the Internet. A patch released for an existing game could potentially change thousands of gaming experiences in an instant. <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> has gone through dozens of playable versions, each one representing a different stage of evolution of the same entity. In the case of <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> which, unlike many games, has no planned “final version,” the model is an ongoing collaboration between what the players want and what the creators want. It’s a battle of perceptions, a contest over many rival mental models of the same game. (Here are echoes of the <span class="rend-i">Fantasy Westward Journey</span> incident in China, where the game world had been changed in a way that players were unhappy with, as I discussed in “A Gamers’ World”). Just as we live in real communities, where the infrastructure has to be maintained so that everyone can live comfortably, so gamers’ lives within <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> depend on collaboration with the game’s creators. It has to be a model that is useful to everyone involved. Gamers have to tell the people who run the game what is wrong and what is right. The people in charge of the infrastructure are providing a service and have to cater to the needs of their customer-citizens if they want to keep making money.</p>
<p>If we look at all this from Wright’s perspective, then <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is a shared mental model in the heads of both thousands of gamers and dozens of developers, with a process of feedback moving cyclically between all those involved. The mental model is not that of one person engaging with a single model on a personal screen but a picture comprised of tens of thousands of impressions of the same model. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is not stuck in a box on an airport concourse to be occasionally admired and toyed with by a passing traveler. It is a single collaborative imaginative enterprise that exists in real time, ready to be examined and enjoyed by anyone who has Internet access and, as my friends constantly point out, anyone who has the time and patience to sink into what is a formidable and forbiddingly nerdy gaming project. Those who have had time have begun to uncover something remarkable and one of the possible future directions for gaming: entertainment that is also massive collaboration.</p>
<p>The ISS project is just one example of how the Internet provides us with the potential for a kind of creative democracy within games. With thousands of people investing time and money in this game, there’s now a chance for a small fraction of them to take things in new directions and figure out their own projects and their own models, just as Smart and Wiinholt have done. Smart told me that he wanted to “see to what extent it is possible to influence the direction of development of a gaming universe,” and the answer is very clear: it is not only possible but essential. What is perhaps less clear is whether Smart and Wiinholt are also discovering the extent to which it is possible to influence the direction of games as a whole. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> represents not simply an example of intriguing game design but also an opportunity: will games grasp these ideas and develop them? They may not. It would be a disheartening dead end.</p>
<p>But there are other opportunities, too. The emergent behavior of gamers in online environments such as <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> represents only one way in which the relationship between games and gamers could potentially develop. The creativity of gamers could change the future of gaming in a number of other possible ways, and I look at these in “Model Living.”</p>

<a name="4.2.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Building Tools</span></h4>
<p>And now for a brief digression to a dreary evening in Bath, England… .</p>
<p>On celebrating someone’s birthday on a freezing winter night, we adjourned our drinking to a town apartment. The place was Spartan, apart from its gaming apparatus. There was a long sofa, a large TV, and a stack of game consoles from different eras. Atop this pile there was a Nintendo Wii, complete with two wireless motion-sensitive controllers and a copy of <span class="rend-i">Wii Sports.</span> An evening that had already been fairly exuberant was suddenly dominated by the yelling of two 20-something women who were wildly punching the air as their supercute Mii avatars duked it out on-screen in a game of virtual boxing. The scene was bizarre but uplifting. We jeered and cheered for the flailing ladies, cracking open fresh tins of booze as we did so.</p>
<p>One of the people next to me on the sofa, a writer of many years’ experience, said: “That, right there, is why Nintendo are the most important thing ever to happen to gaming.” And I thought he was dead right. Yes, what else could matter outside a small group of friends enjoying themselves so completely? How could anything but this sudden joy in technological novelty really be important about games? How could the future of games be anything other than this kind of entertainment, on this kind of evening?</p>
<p>Much of what is currently written about gaming relies on just that kind of assumption: namely, that the significant future of gaming is in what happens with home consoles, in front of the family TV. I touched on this assumption in my essay about Seoul and the PC gamers of East Asia, when I pointed out how strange it seemed that their gaming culture was based around the desktop PC. Here in the West, we can’t help but assume that the most important and vital aspects of gaming are going to be found in the boxes we plug into our television sets. We all have evenings of gaming like that one I had last winter, and we are all struck by the convenience and power of these pluggable entertainment gadgets. Naturally we’re inclined to believe that they will be the dominant, most relevant, most important gaming platforms for the future. It is assumed that their availability and accessibility will be the defining feature of the future of gaming and that their polished games are what everyone really wants to play. It is also assumed that the most interesting events in video gaming are going to be derived from big-budget, best-selling supergames, the likes of which find their home on the PlayStation or the Xbox. For the purposes of most gaming discussion, this assumption seems reasonable enough, but over the last couple of years, I’ve begun to think that there are some problems with it. I’ve hinted at quite a few of these problems already in the present writing, but perhaps it’s time to dig up a few more.</p>
<p>There are reasons to think that the future of gaming and of the behavior of gamers could be more various and less controlled than we might expect from the “home console” model. It might not be big companies that ultimately decide where gaming goes or how it gets there. These issues were encapsulated for me in my meeting back in London with Paul Wedgwood (described in “The Big Smoke”). At the end of our session, the goateed developer said: “The future of media isn’t TV, it’s YouTube. The same sort of thing seems to be true of consoles and PCs. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo control what you see on their screens, like broadcast television, but the PC is unconstrained. That, I think, is a very important difference.” Later, listening to those words played back on my dictating machine, I realized that my interviewee was a living example of the importance of gaming and of why the difference between consoles and PCs was important. Wedgwood was a gamer who had gone pro but who needed a certain culture and certain environment to allow him to do so. And he was working with the YouTube of gaming, having entered his profession via amateur modding.</p>
<p>The modification of games is supported by commercial companies to differing degrees, with many of them releasing tool kits that allow direct modification of game param-eters, with access to level-building tools and other custom-built applications. Wedgwood took full use of these tools, even taking the initiative and getting in touch with the developers directly before the <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> tools had been officially released. Wedgwood’s team was allowed to test the tool kit, and in doing so, they seized a head start for their modification. As the project ripened, Wedgwood began to do huge amounts of promotion and marketing for his game, e-mailing news sites and promoting their work to the gaming teams across Europe. Splash Damage’s mod <span class="rend-i">Q3F</span> was going to be one of <span class="rend-i">Quake III’s</span> most important add-ons, and Wedgwood made sure that everyone knew about it. Once the mod had been released, Wedgwood persuaded gaming community administrators to run tournaments for the game, many of which were to be populated by the small army of <span class="rend-i">Q3F</span> disciples who had signed up to test the mod in its earliest beta stages.</p>
<p>The <span class="rend-i">Q3F</span> mod was a hit and, combined with Wedgwood’s amiable nature, gained the attention of the original game designers, id Software. In mid-2000 the <span class="rend-i">Q3F</span> team were invited to visit QuakeCon, the <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> and <span class="rend-i">Doom</span> fans’ official annual gathering, held in Dallas, Texas. At the convention, the team hosted their modification for their fellow gamers to play. “We manned a table and networked like crazy,” said Wedgwood. “We talked to every mod developer, members of id, every hardware vendor, and just did as much as we could to promote the mod.” It was the turning point for the group: the small team (then just five people) realized that they wanted to be full-time developers, not just volunteering fans. During one of the QuakeCon dinners, they pitched an idea to id’s Graeme Devine (the man behind the adventure classic <span class="rend-i">7th Guest</span>), who told them to get back to basics and stop aiming at the sky. “He thought I was insane,” said Wedgwood. “Although we had a mod, it was a straight port. We knew that we had to demonstrate a better grasp of art and technology.” The team set about replacing all content derived from <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> in their latest iteration of the <span class="rend-i">Q3F</span> mod. The new project would have a new user interface, new maps, new logos, a new soundtrack, new audio, and a complete overhaul of all incidental art materials. “In truth the community hated us,” concedes Wedgwood. “We were taking this pure game that they loved, and I guess it seemed like we were just dressing it up as a portfolio piece—and there would be some truth to that idea. But we were still proud of it: we had new special effects, new models, new skyboxes. We thought we were doing something for the community.” When the team returned to QuakeCon the next year, everything changed. “We had something really really polished to present,” Wedgwood recalled. “And at this point we were introduced to [id Software co-owner] Kevin Cloud and to Jonathan Moses of Activision, who was the producer on <span class="rend-i">Return to Castle Wolfenstein.</span>”</p>
<p>Wedgwood’s company, to be called Splash Damage after the properties of area-of-effect weapons in his favorite games, were soon going to be making commercial games. They designed the multiplayer levels of id Software’s <span class="rend-i">Doom 3,</span> and they designed a multiplayer game based on <span class="rend-i">Return to Castle Wolfenstein,</span> which was eventually released freely over the Internet. As I write this, they are putting the finishing touches to a full-on commercial project, <span class="rend-i">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars,</span> an impressively ambitious futuristic combat game that will eventually spawn its own wave of new mods.</p>
<p>It was only through the possibilities opened up by modding that Wedgwood’s team had been able to create this niche for themselves. Furthermore, the modding culture that has arisen around PC games has supplied the company with much of the human talent necessary to make commercial games. These were gamers who not only had enjoyed playing games but had also realized that there were ways in which these games could be improved or altered. Their compulsive reimagining of games had created something palpable. They had made new games from old, recycling and augmenting. Browsing through modding archives is like visiting a library of rewritten classics. It’s as if someone were able to edit Shakespeare with pulp fiction tropes or rewrite Conrad to beef up the metaphors. There are mods that turn traditional point-and-shoot gun games into John Woo–inspired acrobatic gun juggling; others turn gung ho combat games into hide-and-seek. There are thirty breeds of zombie movie games and also the adventures of a sentient marble. One of the most exquisite mods I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing (at 4 a.m. while the sun was rising) was <span class="rend-i">Air Buccaneers.</span> Based on the hyperbolic sci-fi shooter <span class="rend-i">Unreal Tournament, Air Buccaneers</span> is a game of archaic steampunk airships, each one floating over a smoky gothic landscape. Players pilot the balloons and duel precariously with muzzle-loaded bombards and wildly inaccurate blunderbusses. It is a strange and beautiful experience, unlike anything else I have ever played.</p>
<p>This, in some way, is my answer to Chris Suellentrop’s claims about how games impinge on our imagination. These gamers, the modders, aren’t following given rules: they’re making new ones. Mods do not answer to commercial pressures or to the ideas that game developers are supposed to have accepted. Creating a mod is a project for the inspired and the truly committed, affording imaginative possibilities that cannot be found elsewhere.</p>

<a name="4.2.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Headhunting</span></h4>
<p>Mods have influenced some unique games and some unique gamers. They spawned one of the most popular online games of all time, in the form of <span class="rend-i">Counter-Strike.</span> That game went on to define the European and American professional gaming scene, from 2002 up to the present day. Mods have also allowed many gamers to indulge their esoteric interests and their desire for expression in gaming media. One such person is the British programmer and artist Tom Betts, who has used modding to create some unusual art projects. These include a psychedelic video installation based on live modification of <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> servers during play and a manic, color-filled shoot-’em-up poetically dubbed <span class="rend-i">Endless Fire.</span> For Betts, the modding scene represents a kind of unlegislated terrain in which he could play with bold ideas: “I realized that consoles were missing out on this vibrant element of interactivity. I could argue that consoles patronized the audience by reducing their input options and denying them access to any code or creative interface. However, this was more a case of streamlining interaction to encourage immediacy and broaden the potential audience. Its only recently that consoles have begun to reach back toward the practice of user-generated content and modification. This is perhaps not totally altruistic as console developers were seeing the benefits that modification brought to the PC game market. The mod scene serves as a mechanism to extend product life span, build communities—as well as providing a ground for free beta testing and potential headhunting.”</p>
<p>Betts’s experimental approach drew inspiration from both the games themselves and the excitement of remodeling something that had already been meticulously crafted. His approach echoes major trends in modern culture, in which sampling, cut-ups, and remixing have become essential artistic tools. Like Wedgwood’s, Betts’s creativity relied on the small-scale productivity that was made possible by modding culture. Without these tools, his wish to change and manipulate games would have been frustrated: “Unlike other mediums, it is difficult to translate your creative vision into a game format. The entry barriers to amateur gaming production are daunting and, when considering console platforms, almost impossible. The PC modding scene allows players to become developers without too much hassle, and in many cases, the tools the ‘official’ developers use themselves aren’t much different. The situation becomes blurred, especially where mods provide such a high level of quality as to rival their parent software. The PC has always been a more open platform than consoles, where it’s hard to comment on or alter titles without resorting to machinima techniques or advanced hardware hacks.”</p>
<p>Betts, like many other people undertaking these small-scale, no-budget gaming projects, was thrilled by the freedoms they afforded him: “As a programmer I often code my own projects, but modding often appeals to me as a more interventionist ‘punk’ approach. I wanted to make artwork about games and gaming culture, so actually using the same tools and software as that culture seemed a more direct route to comment upon it. I also feel that modification allows me a route to provide alternative readings of a game and suggest other forms gaming could take. FPS games [first-person shooters, such as <span class="rend-i">Doom</span> and <span class="rend-i">Half-Life</span>] have always seemed on the verge of orgiastic screen-smearing chaos, so that is how I approached most of my mods. At the same time, I wanted the experience to be dislocated from the usual gaming environment, to draw attention to the surrounding culture of games and the issues they raise. Modding can also hold a kind of glamour due to its proximity to hacking and piracy; the idea of mangling all the menus in a game (especially the copyright screen) appealed to me. Gamers would recognize my mods from the original game and be unsettled by the direction and style of alteration, whereas nongamers were astounded when they realized the culture and software behind the work.”</p>
<p>Where Betts enjoyed chaotic artistic freedom, other mods end up being simply continuations of projects that were started by commercial companies. Games like <span class="rend-i">Vampire: Bloodlines</span> or <span class="rend-i">Giants: Citizen Kabuto</span> were so ambitious and so enchanting that gamers fell in love with them and ended up working on them even after the respective commercial companies moved on to other things. The fans continued where normal development had ceased: fixing bugs, installing new features, and so on. One of the most impressive instances of the continuation of these “abandoned” games involves a racing game called <span class="rend-i">Grand Prix Legends.</span> Notoriously realistic and unforgiving, this ancient racer has long been forgotten by commercial concerns. The hard-core racing gamers who love it, however, continue to tweak and improve the ancient masterpiece to this day. The game has been enhanced in every conceivable manner over the intervening years, including a full graphical overhaul to bring it up to date with contemporary visual standards. These gamers aren’t interested in the commercial cycle of new games; instead, their concern is to keep the past alive and to keep their favorite games evolving.</p>
<p>Wedgwood’s point about consoles being analogous to broadcast media, with the major publishing companies being able to control exactly what it is that we see on our screens, was born of this kind of homegrown culture. The big console companies get to decide what games are allowed on their machines and, therefore, who makes them. They decide who can change their games and when they are to be discarded entirely. The PC, on the other hand, (so far) refuses any such guidelines. (This mildly contentious statement might end up being an untruth, because Microsoft exerts so much influence through its Windows operating system—the only viable platform for PC gaming—and that influence is increasing.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the Internet has given PC users relative freedom to distribute whatever gamers can make, with only occasional lawsuits to interrupt those projects that worry the copyright watchers. Crucially, broadcast systems tend to aim for one thing: the best seller, or the ratings topper. This commercial demand has warped the games market in the direction of huge budgets and mass production, a trend that has swamped the possibilities for low-scale or independent production. While independent filmmaking is still viable, independent game making has become increasingly difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>Digital distribution could alter this decline. Downloading games online cuts out the retailer and the publisher: gamers can buy games directly from their creators, just as they can download mods for free. Even console games developers are getting in on new ways of distributing games: Xbox Live Arcade provides an opportunity for the smaller, less popular, and potentially highly innovative independent titles to find a market. Of course, it is still controlled to some extent, and there is still the possibility that the console manufacturers will get to say what moves through their networks. In fact, increasingly Byzantine security controls on more recent iterations of Microsoft’s operating system threaten the efficiency of independent production on the PC, too. We gamers just have to hope that the channels remain open and free.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, it’s the unconstrained production possibilities of the PC—as much a tool and development platform as it is a gaming machine—that has allowed modding to come as far as it has done. And, again, the Internet is the great enabler. The online culture of modding means that teams like Wedgwood’s Splash Damage can form from people who live in a dozen different countries, in different time zones, and who can still work on the same project, to the same end. Not all modders will enter the commercial arena: and that’s a good thing for gamers. For the most part, modding has been about communal gaming and personal entertainment—things done for the love of games, rather than for the love of cash. Recalling the joys of his modding days, Wedgwood told me about “development parties” he would hold at his home during those early years. His team would fly in from all across Europe for a long weekend of eating pizza and building their game. Back then, they were doing it for the fans and for themselves. The PC, Wedgwood was keen to emphasize, is still a fertile ground for such activities: gamers can be playing a game one day and rebuilding it the next.</p>

<a name="4.2.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Superhero Outfits</span></h4>
<p>It’s a month before my Reykjavik trip (described in “The Special Relationship”), and I’m in the grim northern town of Huddersfield. The view across the Yorkshire valleys is wondrous—green hills, a setting sun throwing the city below into the shade. Huddersfield itself is tired and partially abandoned. The houses are built of gray and black stone, and some have the windows boarded up. The expanding value surge led by the London property boom has not reached this far into the provinces.</p>
<p>I’m sitting at a kitchen table in one of those terraced Victorian houses, thinking about how the tradition of creativity in gaming goes back decades. Above all, I’m thinking about how small groups of gamers collaborate on building scenarios for pen-and-paper role-playing games like <span class="rend-i">Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</span> I’ve joined a group of gamers who have been playing the same <span class="rend-i">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> campaign for over a decade. The chronicle of their exploits, kept by a wry military intelligence officer from Cheltenham, has reached a quarter of a million words. Each week, they collaborate to create a story of high adventure, filled with absurd humor and ludicrously misfiring plans. Ideas are generated spontaneously in conversation, and the consequences are hilariously outlandish: heroic characters turned to mud, a fountain of kidnapped dwarves ejected from a collapsing pocket dimension, the god of travel getting lost… . It’s their story, and no one else will ever be able to live it.</p>
<p>The <span class="rend-i">D&amp;D</span> group is a fine example of how the promise of creativity and of goofing off with friends makes gaming a long-term commitment—something we can sign up to and feel rewarded by for year upon year. The nondigital gaming community has long been diverse and prolific. There have long been rich, complex communities based around the “play-by-mail” games that were so popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. Then there are the war gamers and the board gamers who put everything into the creation of their miniature model worlds: the incredible precision of painted <span class="rend-i">Warhammer</span> armies and the authentic scenery of Napoleonic conflicts on a tabletop—sometimes taking years to create. All these impulses have found their way into computerized gaming. What these guys do on the weekends when they can meet has, in effect, been facilitated and mass-produced by the Internet. We can all get involved in gaming—hands-on, communal, and rewarding—and we don’t even have to be in the same room. Games like <span class="rend-i">Neverwinter Nights</span> have allowed gamers to create <span class="rend-i">D&amp;D</span> scenarios for anyone in the world, while the game versions of <span class="rend-i">Warhammer</span> games allow meticulous painting of banners and armies that can then be distributed directly across the Net for online battles.</p>
<p>The digital gaming world has a long and healthy prehistory of user creativity. Before the likes of <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> furnished online worlds with lavish graphic content, there were online games called MUDs, or “multiuser dungeons.” These were text-based adventure games where Net users were able to fight monsters, talk, trade, and go on quests, all within a text-driven (generally natural language) system. MUDs were multiplayer and based entirely on what could be written into the text interface. These “worlds” were extremely flexible and allowed gamers to rebuild their content with relative ease. Like the sandbox games of today, MUDs relied on gamers to define many of their own goals and to create content. Many of these age-old text worlds are still running today, thanks to the way they directly involved the gamers in their workings and encouraged creativity.</p>
<p>Contemporary electronic games offer a wide array of options for personalization and content bending, and this goes a long way toward explaining their continuing popularity. <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft,</span> for example, the most commercial of the online role-playing games, leaves plenty of scope for enterprising gamers to modify the game’s interface, and this latitude has in turn altered and refined how the game is played. The large-scale invasions of monster-filled dungeons often depend on these third-party tweaks to the original format to be pulled off successfully. These modifications change how the information that is available to the player presents itself—with timers, notifications, and interface tweaks making the game a different experience from the vanilla game. This is how we played <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> in years past: we’d tear up original configuration files to create ugly but hyperfunctional interfaces, with graphic detail removed and unnecessary prettiness expunged for the sake of efficiency. Although such alterations to the user interface may seem trivial to observers, they are crucial to hard-core players—the tiniest changes in invisible game variables were immensely important to my <span class="rend-i">Quake</span>-playing colleagues, especially when we were competing for league points and credibility. Like the tweaks made to racing cars, the changes made to the aspects of the game that governed frame rate and smoothness of play would decide between victory and death. The fact that Blizzard, the company behind <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft,</span> didn’t prohibit such modification in their game interface turned out to be to their advantage, as well as handy for hard-core gamers. Features of popular modifications have turned up in the basic interface—features that the designers hadn’t thought of or hadn’t been sure whether they wanted to implement.</p>
<p>Games don’t have to be closed off, finished, or abandoned. Nor do they have to be fixed and unchanged. Learning to play might be about learning the rules of a game, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t aspire to change them. Of course, many of the best games are solo, solitary experiences that have been tightly scripted and carefully crafted by large teams of highly paid designers, and these cannot be modified easily. These big commercial games will also undoubtedly figure prominently in the future of games, but I nevertheless anticipate gamers finding increasingly diverse uses for messier, less product-oriented projects. The rigid masterworks that are fabricated like Hollywood films in the great production studios should only be seen as one possible way of gaming.</p>
<p>We will learn to value bizarre modifications and independent experiments far more than we do today: these proj-ects are, in their own small way, the vanguard or avant-garde; and the ideas they generate may well point corporate, risk-averse projects in new directions. Just recently, a teleportation game called <span class="rend-i">Narbacular Drop</span> made this transition from weird private project to commercial behemoth. This clever, Escher-like game, which was freely downloadable and the result of a university project, went on to inspire the game <span class="rend-i">Portal,</span> a polished and humorous commercial release from Valve Software, one of the most successful games companies in the world. The evolution of <span class="rend-i">Portal</span> is exciting because it demonstrates how small-scale independent thinking can reinvigorate commercial game design, delivering to jaded consumers the unprecedented experience of a first-person puzzle game riddled with black humor.</p>
<p>But there is also more than design innovation at stake here. Games that use open-ended approaches like that of <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> can be seen as incubators for personal creativity. More than a puzzle, a blaze of action, or an intricate adventure, they offer a set of building blocks—conceptual Lego kits. Finding a project for yourself within a game world could be much like finding out what you want to do in life generally: experimentation, exploration, coping with both social and physical situations. Games are providing gamers with a lexicon in which many different kinds of creativity are possible. Gamers might want to rework an old classic or fix the bugs in a favorite game. Or, like Smart and Wiinholt, they might want to influence the direction of a virtual world in which tens of thousands of other people participate. Gamers may wish to set up a backpack manufacturing trade in <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> or run an online sports team. The options are open and getting more diverse all the time.</p>
<p>Of all the gaming platforms, the PC enables this broad approach to gaming the best, while the broadcast nature of consoles has so far found little place for these methods. In this way, the future possibilities for PC games can be seen as just another aspect of the way the Internet is now being used. Like MySpace (which provides a particular framework for music sharing and socializing), DeviantArt (which supplies a forum for showing off artwork), or even Wikipedia (in which users author and edit encyclopedia entries), games can harness our creativity by providing a medium with which gamers can develop their own esoteric projects. Games provide tools, frameworks, and inspiration. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> inspired the ISS project that was devised and executed by Smart and Wiinholt (which I discussed in “The Special Relationship”). Meanwhile, on a far smaller scale, the superhero game <span class="rend-i">City of Heroes</span> provides gamers with the possibility for designing superhero outfits and secret lairs. Of course, these games also offer gamers limited room to maneuver, because, as in the case of a wiki (a system enabling collaborative writing on certain themes) or a MySpace page, they’re designed for quite specific uses. MySpace is about being a music fan and sharing a few photos, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is about galactic conflict, and so on. These games are designed to give us goals, quests, and aspirations within a certain context. We play them because we’re gamers, and our attraction to space war or goblin bashing means that we are gamers long before exposure to the medium inspires us to become modders, emergence-minded tech experts, or anything else that might develop from the act of simply playing games. Our need to be distracted, to avoid boredom, is simply the starting point. But it’s a fine starting point that should not be dismissed lightly.</p>
<p>I would like to see a genuine divergence between the games that rely on big studios and multimillion-dollar production and the games that rely on the innate creativity of gamers. This might end up creating quite different kinds of gamers, too: those who want to sit down and be overwhelmed by <span class="rend-i">Final Fantasy</span>’s sweeping emotions and operatic drama and those who want to be able to tinker and mess around in their own private corners of the universe. Luis von Ahn is right about gaming having led to many “wasted cycles” of human computing (as I discuss in “Propagandists”), but perhaps the most appropriate application for the energies of gamers is in improving and expanding the games themselves. If designers can encourage gamers to collaborate with them through play, thus sparing us the hard work that modding entails, then everyone wins. We get to create content while goofing off with our friends and, at the same time, can enable gaming companies to realize even more ambitious projects.</p>
<p>One game that is already making moves in this direction is Will Wright’s <span class="rend-i">Spore</span> (aka <span class="rend-i">Sim Everything</span>). The game provides players with tools with which to build their own creature, a creature that has the potential to be completely unique. Thanks to the complexity of the procedural animal editor and the mass of options provided by Wright’s team, no two <span class="rend-i">Spore</span> life-forms need be the same, and this has some pretty profound consequences for the game world. The player evolves a rudimentary creature through various stages of sophistication (from microbe, to animal, to sentient civilization) into what is ultimately a spacefaring culture, traveling from one star system to the next across a vast galaxy: yet the player’s experience of doing so will depend largely on the morphology of his or her creature. The player has, in part, designed his or her own experience.</p>
<p>Once <span class="rend-i">Spore</span> players begin to explore that galaxy, they encounter other races and discover other planets. Wright’s team will not have to design the creatures that inhabit these other planets, because the players will do it for them. As gamers develop their own creatures, their designs are uploaded to the Net and used to populate the universes of other gamers. It’s not a multiplayer game as such, but it does make it possible for what someone does in one single-player game on their home computer to have a direct (and entertaining) effect on what happens on another computer on the far side of the world. It’s this kind of insight into how the creativity of gamers can be harnessed that will change how building games for gamers should be understood.</p>
<p>Wright came to understand this principle by looking at how his previous game <span class="rend-i">The Sims</span> had inspired people to design household objects. <span class="rend-i">The Sims</span> is one of the best-selling games of all time. Only a fraction of the gamers who bought it had to produce in-game items for there to be a wealth of extra free content. All they needed were the tools to make their designs possible in the game world. The easier it becomes for gamers to produce in-game content—indeed, if creation of content is the game—then the more of it there will be to furnish game worlds like that of <span class="rend-i">The Sims.</span> This approach reduces costs for game developers, because they don’t have to pay studios filled with artists. It benefits gamers, too: they are engaging with their medium creatively and productively in order to make something happen. Like Smart and Wiinholt, they will be, at least in some small way, creators themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.2.4"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Plague</span></h4>
<p>An interpollination of gaming ideas is taking place across our culture. Thanks to the way that gamers continually rattle around in the space provided for them, emergent situations and user-generated materials are arising in unexpected places and causing unexpected fallout. The fresh perspectives provided by harnessing the productivity of gamers have invited developers to take new paths in the development of future games. In a 2006 edition of <span class="rend-i">Receiver</span> magazine, David J. Edery, worldwide games portfolio planner for Xbox Live Arcade and a research affiliate of the MIT Comparative Media Studies program, described the whole phenomenon as follows: “In <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto,</span> you can spray graffiti on the walls of the virtual cityscape. What if players were enabled to customize their graffiti in great detail? The game could automatically upload player-generated graffiti to a server, where it would be randomly downloaded by other game instances in controlled quantities. The cityscape would quickly fill up with legitimate graffiti, which would contribute to a much more authentic gameplay experience overall. And perhaps players could be enabled to somehow vote on other players’ graffiti, or add to it, or overwrite it?” Suddenly the possibilities open up—the cities of <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto</span> become the canvas of gaming artists across the world. They’re not playing in the same game, like gamers do in <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> or <span class="rend-i">EVE Online,</span> but nevertheless they’re affecting each other’s experiences. Games of all kinds can be transformed by the activity of gamers, if appropriate tools can be provided. We don’t have to be as profoundly committed as Paul Wedgwood and his team to produce something useful or interesting—our contributions to change and content creation could be minute, but they would nevertheless count for something.</p>
<p>Sony’s Game Developers Conference speech in 2007 focused on a game called <span class="rend-i">Little Big Planet,</span> which builds a traditional platform game (think <span class="rend-i">Mario</span> or <span class="rend-i">Sonic</span>) around the concept of allowing gamers ideas to construct the platform environments for themselves. <span class="rend-i">Little Big Planet</span>’s cute avatars jump into multiplayer games to build the game levels before playing them. These are activities that can be shared across the Internet or simply played at home with friends. It’s enormously appealing both as a game and as a creative ideal for gamers generally. <span class="rend-i">Little Big Planet</span> presents games as malleable, communicable objects, built for gamers to customize and distort as they see fit. Things like this and like the bizarre sandbox modification of <span class="rend-i">Half-Life 2</span> called <span class="rend-i">Garry’s Mod</span> are becoming facilitators of our imagination, ready to be bounced into someone else’s gaming like a conceptual mind bomb: “Look at what I made.” The future of games, say the big companies, is in new and accessible versions of the sandbox games: the places where gamers use games as sculptural, expressive media.</p>
<p>This kind of application is not limited to play. Games are also creating useful nongaming applications by virtue of their unusual approach to sharing and processing various types of information. The massively popular photo-sharing system Flickr, for example, was built using the tools developed for a failed massively multiplayer game known as <span class="rend-i">Game Neverending.</span> Although the game itself—a lighthearted exercise in collaborative object creation and media sharing—never made it past the beta stage, it ended up birthing one of the most important sites on the contemporary Internet. Flickr’s image gallery architecture owes its existence to the gaming ambitions of its parent company—the aptly named Ludicorp—whose tools and technology concepts are used everyday in something that is definitely not a game. As the money spent on gaming increases and the things that games intended to achieve expand, so this kind of secondary application will become increasingly common.</p>
<p>On an even wider scale, games are leaking from one format to another. One example of this is the evolution of the <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> user-made game <span class="rend-i">Tringo.</span> It was invented so that people would have something to play within <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> and a reason to spend time and virtual cash within the user-made world. But <span class="rend-i">Tringo</span> soon became so popular among the inhabitants of <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> that it was noticed outside the world and licensed for development as a commercial game on the Game Boy Advance. As well as being reworked and launched in the commercial format, it was polished up and then relaunched within <span class="rend-i">Second Life,</span> in an effort to generate even more virtual capital (capital that could then be exchanged for real U.S. dollars on the LindeX, <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span>’s exchange system for changing virtual to real money). <span class="rend-i">Tringo</span> had become a leaky object: moving between physical and virtual realities seamlessly. It was a virtual entity that had become a physical product, while still making money within a virtual world.</p>
<p>Other, more serious phenomena have emerged from idle play, and many of them could one day have applications beyond gaming. One of the most widely discussed examples is the <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> plague. This accidental virtual contagion was caused by an in-game curse called “the Corrupted Blood plague.” The Corrupted Blood plague was transferred from one game character to the next and then back again, a bit like a real disease, causing massive problems for gamers as it swept through populated areas. The game’s designers had intended the plague to be a temporary feature in one of the game’s dungeons, but people left the area before the infection had cleared up, and so the curse spread through the game, much like a real-world epidemic.</p>
<p>The plague was devastating and, like real such outbreaks, was caused by the speedy, unwitting travel of gamers around their world. It was so virulent that even quarantine didn’t help—servers had to be rebooted and the game code rewritten to finally curb disaster. Computers are, of course, often used to model the spread of disease, but such simulations only take into account routine behavior. What was exciting to epidemiologists about the <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> plague was that it was driven by the activities of thousands of real people and therefore provided a much more complex model than those generally used on epidemic-modeling programs. The random behavior and odd breaks in routine that a computer simulation is unable to predict or map emerged spontaneously from the plague-ridden gamers, meaning that they could potentially have provided a useful tool for modeling the spread of disease. This brings us back once again to von Ahn’s concept of human computing, where games are about harnessing gamers and putting them to use without their even knowing. Even without having to build a new game, the models of <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> could potentially be of use to science as a plague-mapping tool. It might even be possible to introduce symptom-free diseases to a game and then use real people’s behavior to model its spread, without their ever knowing. This, in turn, could be used to model many of the problems faced by epidemiologists in the real world, such as people with innate immunity and others who are silent carriers, not knowing that they harbor the disease. Nina Fefferman of Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston plans to do exactly that, although, at the time of this writing, she has been unable to get any games companies to perform such experiments on their customers.</p>
<p>Perhaps needless to say, Fefferman’s ideas have not avoided vocal criticism—the <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> outbreak was in a virtual world, in which there is no death, and such a situation is hardly comparable to a real one. Nevertheless, the mechanical fact of it, that the gaming model could, even in theory, be used to map structures of information applicable to many different scenarios, suggests thrilling possibilities for what gamers might be able to achieve, given some lateral thinking. The games of the future might have more than one application at a given time, and many of those applications might well be invisible to the people playing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="4.2.5"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Method</span></h4>
<p>Back on Earth, at the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> Fanfest, such metagaming applications seemed far away. Free beer tokens, smiling lab technicians from Copenhagen, polite conversation about respective socioeconomic backgrounds—it could have been the party stage of any conference in the world. Nevertheless, the kind of life and excitement that surrounds the Fanfest in Reykjavik suggests that this generation of gamers has just begun to find itself. The gamers in Reykjavik were heading out into this strange new world of emergent plans and game-driven socialization without a second thought. They were its willing passengers, each of them paying for a ride on this journey of exploration. Gamers across the world have all bought into that in some way: games are paying for a unique kind of hi-tech progress, experimentation that would otherwise be unjustified and unimaginable.</p>
<p>This festival was partly a social event and partly another aspect of the collaboration that <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> has engendered. The massively social nature of online games makes them particularly suitable as a basis for this kind of out-of-game socializing. Gamers are able to talk over the Net and get to know each other without meeting, long before they brave an event like this. Gatherings like the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> Fanfest are taking place because of the interaction of players within the game. Without this connection or conduit, thousands of friendships might never have come to be. It seems understandable, perhaps even obvious, that games would generate their own internal modes of playfulness (such as rearranging furniture in a game of <span class="rend-i">Thievery</span>), but the idea that they now have wider social effects remains provocative. These trends could have unique consequences: there are now millions of people interacting and socializing in online game worlds, and many of them will choose to take their relationships further—to meet at events like the Fanfest and in countless other contexts. Stories of people having met and married through online games are by now too common to mention.</p>
<p>Some of the people who meet outside games, like Wedgwood or like Smart and Wiinholt, see gaming as an opportunity to do something more than obtaining high scores or besting lap times. They see games as ways of networking, of making new allies and fresh work contacts. These gamers are people who are engaging with gaming productively and dragging others along with them. (<span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> has repeatedly been called the new golf within the technology industry, because young executives are now just as likely to be able to hang out with the bosses in the Dwarven city of Ironforge as they are on the real-world golf course.)</p>
<p>Other gamers, meanwhile, are engaging with games in ways that have been seen as satirical, progressive, and even criminal. On the sidelines of the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> Fanfest lurked one of its most notorious players, Istvaan Shogaatsu. Known to the community only by his in-game nickname, Shogaatsu has become a legendary figure. He seemed to be playing the role of legend in person, too: looking like an incidental character in <span class="rend-i">The Matrix,</span> he strutted across the hotel carpets in a futuristic costume and sunglasses, ultrahip piercings protruding from his handsome face. There was pointing and muttering at his presence. The <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> gamers knew him by reputation.</p>
<p>Shogaatsu’s Guiding Hand Social Club is a bona fide secret organization within <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> and the polar opposite of the ISS project. Shogaatsu was the mastermind and key perpetrator behind the infiltration and massive betrayal of a major <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> corporation. It was one of the most inspiring pieces of play ever seen in a game, but also one of the cruelest and most devastating. Revealed with a flourish on the <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> forums, the attack by the Guiding Hand Social Club on the wealthy Ubiqua Seraph Corporation was a masterstroke of patience and cunning.</p>
<p>Initially, the Guiding Hand, who had previously set themselves up as committed assassins, had been hired to kill the CEO of Ubiqua Seraph and were to be paid handsomely for the task. Their method, though, was not the crude and difficult matter of waging war and killing the mark by martial means alone. Instead, the Guiding Hand infiltrated Ubiqua Seraph to the highest level, taking 12 months to ingratiate themselves with the corporation and gain access to its extensive resources. Like the 1930s FBI infiltrators who organized the Communist Party meetings in which suspected conspirators were to be arrested, the Guiding Hand’s own influence on the CEO of Ubiqua Seraph arranged the time and place of her doom. Not only did they schedule the trap, but the executioner was to be a fellow colleague, a director of her own corporation, and just another member of the Guiding Hand.</p>
<p>When the time was right, the Guiding Hand ambushed their quarry in space, claimed the bounty, and pillaged the corporate coffers. A bounty that had originally seemed like a large sum was but a fraction of what the Guiding Hand plot would actually claim in this takedown. The mark lost her near-priceless battleship, one of a number of limited edition objects that the developers dropped into the game. She also saw the assets of her corporation, which she and her corp mates had worked for 18 months to accrue, ransacked by Guiding Hand infiltrators. The Guiding Hand members who devastated Ubiqua Seraph took some 30 billion ISK (interstellar kredits) in game money and assets, an amount that, if taken at contemporary eBay exchange rates for <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s virtual currency to real cash, came in at a staggering $16,500. Ubiqua Seraph was far from destroyed, but it’s impossible to gauge the psychological impact of such a brutal strike on the players behind Ubiqua Seraph itself. Could they ever trust other online gamers again? All of which begs the question: are such devastating events really smart play or just acts of outright cruelty?</p>
<p>This wasn’t just a devious bit of gamer backstabbing; it was a genuine betrayal of personal trust and kinship. And it also reveals the extent to which our online identities have new and unforeseen vulnerabilities. The excuse “Oh but it’s only a game” doesn’t quite cut it when you consider that the legitimate members of Ubiqua Seraph had poured years of their lives into building this virtual entity. It was something they had invested countless hours into building, and the Guiding Hand actions represent a staggering act of virtual theft. Nevertheless, the action destroyed the corporation legitimately and within the parameters of the game. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>’s creators quietly applauded Shogaatsu’s cunning malevolence: this was emergent behavior as valid and exciting as anything that could be engineered by designers like Smart and Wiinholt. Shogaatsu had influenced a game world, stunning its population with his audacity. Whatever the ethics, Shogaatsu’s work attracted many more like-minded gamers to come and see what they could achieve in the same game. This was a gamer playing the bad guy, and we could all see that he did it brilliantly.</p>

<a name="4.2.6"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Grief Caused</span></h4>
<p>There were other players at the Fanfest whose reputation preceded them as well. Among the most playful of these were members of the GoonSwarm, a vast in-game alliance affiliated with the online collective Something Awful. Something Awful, whose comedy-oriented review-driven Web site boasts one of the Internet’s most active discussion forums, has a presence across a wide number of online games. Like many other groups who are not affiliated with a particular game, their ability to roam across many different game worlds provides them with an easy way into games communities. The 90,000 registered forum users can pretty much depend on an instant Goon fraternity in almost whatever game they’re interested in. Thanks to a history of gaming exploits and the general scatologically angled humor of Something Awful, the Goons have a reputation as being a disruptive influence in many games. Their philosophy seems to be simply that people should not take anything on the Internet seriously.</p>
<p>In the case of <span class="rend-i">EVE Online,</span> the Goons started out as a mass of inexperienced players marauding around the galaxy, overwhelming their enemies by sheer force of numbers, and often dying horribly as a result of their lack of skill or experience. As the organization has grown and consolidated its assets, it has developed into one of the most significant in-game factions, though the mad verve still remains. The Goons have been derided and mocked by many groups within <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> thanks to allegations of dubious tactics, but the truth is that they’ve largely acted within the spirit of the game. As ludicrous as their swarms of beginner ships might have been, they’re a force to be reckoned with these days, and despite their characterization of <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> as “something awful,” they work hard to maintain a lively, welcoming empire.</p>
<p>The Goons’ most significant contribution to the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> universe was a result of one of the most bitterly contested subjects in the history of the game. One enterprising gamer had discovered elements of “corruption” within CCP and publicized this fact ruthlessly and relentlessly both inside the game forums and on his own well-trafficked blog. He alleged that one of the developers had been using his administrative powers to help out the players that the developer associated with in the game world. The alliance he had helped out was the powerful and constant adversary of the Goons. This led to a continuing campaign, in which the Goons publicized more alleged corruption, including what they regarded as an active infiltration by a member of the development staff into their in-game corporations. The subject was, perhaps not unsurprisingly, an extremely contentious one for CCP. The developers denied most charges of corruption and pledged to set right the actions of their one errant staff member. Of course, being a private corporation governing a public “world,” there was no reason to believe them, as the Goons were pleased to point out. Finally, just as this writing went to press, CCP made a bold move and another step toward a mature phase of collaborative multiplayer entertainment: they pledged to allow player elections that would create an “oversight committee” of player ombudsmen. These neutral representatives of the community would be allowed total access to the workings of the company and the governance of the game and, as such, would ensure that there was no culture of corruption within CCP itself. CCP CEO Hilmar Petursson told the <span class="rend-i">New York Times:</span> “Perception is reality, and if a substantial part of our community feels like we are biased, whether it is true or not, it is true to them. <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> is not a computer game. It is an emerging nation, and we have to address it like a nation being accused of corruption.” The elections should have taken place by the time you read these words. More rhetoric? Perhaps, but even the Goons had to admit that this was a brave experiment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Something Awful crowd has been rather more destructive in <span class="rend-i">Second Life,</span> where the scripting and building systems have allowed them to perform all kinds of outrageous actions. Known as W-Hats in their <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> incarnation, the Goons have satirized events such as the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the assassination attempt on the last pope and have indulged in numerous other troublemaking activities. Of course, outrageousness in <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> is nothing unusual, but it’s the skill that many of the W-Hats have displayed that really astonishes: these are talented individuals who regularly use their remarkable talents for purely malevolent purposes. The W-Hats have engaged in numerous destructive attacks across <span class="rend-i">Second Life,</span> including many that have been categorized as criminal by their victims. Showers of pornographic imagery, “lag bombs” that slow a game server down to the point of uselessness—these are acts analogous to terrorism. The perpetrators of these actions are pursuing a kind of virtual anarchism, where maddening chaos is caused just because. Many of the W-Hats seem to take pride in the grief caused, and their victims have often cried out for criminal remonstration. Something Awful does not sanction any of these actions, of course, and goes out of its way to point out that people should not break the terms of service supplied by game worlds. Nevertheless, the bad seeds remain, because that’s where their philosophy was rooted. These people, like those who were attracted to the ISS project, have found a tribe within a tribe—they have connected with like-minded allies. First they found gaming, then specific games, then an ethos within that game.</p>
<p>These anarchists, like the ISS and others, are pushing boundaries. They are living examples of why gaming doesn’t force us—any more than does any other medium—to learn to obey rules. If anything, it simply gives us new rules to break, new things to subvert, and new constructs to tear down. There’s always someone who wants to smash it up, always someone who will push things to the breaking point, just because it is human to do so.</p>
<p>All these activities seem to have ramifications for our real lives as well as our gaming ones. The U.S. State Department has been looking at how to tax game earnings since they learned that people could make money through virtual business. How long before they start legislating to protect citizens from online assault? If these actions really are criminal, as both gaming terms of service and the reactions of the victims of such attacks seem to imply, then doesn’t this online anarchism have real, legal implications?</p>
<p>These questions raise further, fundamental questions about the future of personhood. What parts of our lives actually constitute our personal identity? Is it just the things you do, day to day, in your everyday life, or does our identity extend into game worlds? The knee-jerk reaction is that games provide us with alternate identities, masks that have no value. Perhaps that was once true, but it doesn’t seem to be anymore. We’re not acting or pretending: I am my spaceship, or my superhero, or my robo-suited explorer. If I have invested time and money in these extensions of my everyday life, then I deserve respect and protection.</p>
<p>Ideas such as these are provoking a great deal of thought among observers of digital culture. Julian Dibbell wrote two prescient books, <span class="rend-i">My Tiny Life</span> and <span class="rend-i">Play Money,</span> about the meaning, economics, and values of online life. Dibbell makes a powerful case for the contemporary social and political importance of virtual interactions, as well as summing up something about their weird, hybrid nature as both games and monetary systems: “Games attract us with their very lack of consequence,” Dibbell wrote in <span class="rend-i">Wired</span> magazine, “whereas economies confront us with the least trivial pursuit of all, the pursuit of happiness.”</p>

<a name="4.2.7"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Tribes</span></h4>
<p>We wander into Reykjavik to take a break from the festival. Braving freezing squalls, we set out to find a famed fish bar, the Seafood Cellar. I had told my companion that this was <span class="rend-i">the</span> place to eat, and so we were determined to check it out. The beautiful six-foot girl on the front desk shakes her head: no booking, no food. She says she’s sorry, but it doesn’t seem like an apology: it seems like a dismissal. Ruefully we step back out onto the street and wander past a couple of pizza parlors. It’s too cold to browse, but we didn’t travel this far north to end up eating Italian. Eventually we find a bar that serves rather more traditional Scandinavian food—steamed haddock and some kind of potato salad. It’s good. Even better thanks to the music: The Smiths, the Pixies, Patti Smith, and some Elvis Costello. A young man wearing a black T-shirt and an apron delivers the food to our table. I glimpse a single metallic <span class="rend-i">Space Invader</span> hanging from his key ring. I want to point it out to him and offer some gaming solidarity—to say, “Brother!” But I don’t. Too inane. Too far removed from my tribe. Maybe he just liked the design. I concentrate on the fish.</p>
<p>The talk at our table is, inevitably, about gaming. Being the more ludo-literate member of our duo, I reel off some recommendations: <span class="rend-i">Fahrenheit</span> (aka <span class="rend-i">Indigo Prophecy</span> in the United States) is, I explain, a masterpiece of modern video game storytelling. It breaks conventions, uses the medium to surprise us, and creates a worthwhile fiction. This, I suggest, is where the seemingly redundant concept of the “interactive movie” has ended up. My companion makes a note of the name, intending to buy a copy when he returns home to the United States. Then he asks, “Do you think you’ve played <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> this long because of the game or because of the people?”</p>
<p>Tough question. We’re all familiar with the way pop culture brings dispersed communities together: we watch an episode of <span class="rend-i">Heroes</span> and then talk about it in the office the next day. Our knowledge of this TV show or that pop record gives us a common culture to work with. But <span class="rend-i">EVE</span>-like online games create something else: a cooperative project. We fight battles together; we explore the unknown together; we share jokes that are only possible within that particular game. We all have knowledge about certain games, but rather than chatting about lone experiences (as we might do when reporting on our adventures on the latest <span class="rend-i">Zelda</span> game), we are able to discuss group plans and group ambitions that are possible within online games. The group I play with has made this very easy. Everyone is on the same page, and we’ve adopted a recruitment policy of “one jump removed,” meaning that anyone joining the group must know one of us from outside—whether from another online game or from everyday life. I quit playing <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> several times before I helped to assemble this group of online friends. If they hadn’t made the long-term projects we have undertaken possible, <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> might have been just another discarded experience—a curiosity I picked up for a while but eventually discovered to be useless.</p>
<p>Initially, online gaming groups formed out of teams or role-playing groups (such as MUD groups). But now, it seems that they are becoming more like actual communities or tribes. Like entertainment-seeking nomads, they can move from one game to the next. If the future of games ends up being focused on user-generated works, then we will probably join projects because we like gaming with particular people we have met elsewhere. We might like the look of what they are making or how they are influencing the game world they play in, but it’ll be the gamers themselves that reinforce our commitment or define how our gaming is experienced. It’s happening already: the anarchic attitudes that the Something Awful affiliates have brought with their gaming exploits are just one example of how gamers are bringing real-world predispositions to gaming worlds. If my current <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> tribe moves to another game, I will follow because I will expect to find a similar climate of cooperation and quiet success and because I know they would only move on if the opportunities afforded by the new space are similar or better.</p>
<p>As elsewhere in the world of gaming, many tribes were in evidence at the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> Fanfest. Subtle distinctions between what different people want from this game ended up defining who they had drinks with and what they talked about. As much as gamers can be expected to generate content and build game worlds, I suspect what they’re really building in the bars of Seoul and the Hotel bars of Reykjavik are new social networks that will last way beyond the life spans of the games that currently preoccupy them.</p>
<p>It’s telling that I recognize names from the fast-paced gung ho death-match era of <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> among the most aggressive pirates and the most destruction-oriented of the <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> players. The manufacturers and the traders of <span class="rend-i">EVE,</span> meanwhile, were often architects in <span class="rend-i">Star Wars Galaxies</span> or obsessive <span class="rend-i">Tycoon</span> enthusiasts whose simulated cities were so rich in perfectly balanced futurist cityscapes as to be unimaginable by the casual player. Meanwhile, other gamers—especially those for whom mainstream games are never weird enough—seem to turn up in all kinds of unusual places, exploring the underbelly of gaming that the crowd has ignored. They lose themselves in one-man online worlds like the bizarre <span class="rend-i">A Tractor,</span> obsess over obscenely difficult fighting games like <span class="rend-i">Godhand,</span> or construct intricate military scenarios for <span class="rend-i">Operation Flashpoint.</span> These are people who value games as part of the sum of human experiences—as things that could not have existed before and may not exist again. They’re dissatisfied with what is presented to us as the acceptable, desirable mainstream and are looking for the new and the weird. Their attitudes are not the attitudes of most gamers: they are the kind of neophiles who are interested in games because games are the newest medium they can find. Nevertheless, it’s never quite new enough.</p>
