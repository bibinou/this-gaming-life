<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="2.1.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">A New Limb</span></h4>
<p>In May 2000 I was fired from my job as a reporter on a finance newsletter because of an obsession with a video game. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>The job had two parts. The first part was desperately dull but easy enough for me to bumble through. Each morning I drove out to a farmhouse office complex located deep in the English countryside and sat on a Herman Miller chair in front of a large curvilinear desk. There I processed articles about how to format corporate curricula vitae or occasionally attempted to make sense of the information I had gathered in the second part of my job. Most of the time, however, I spent clicking through a series of online forums where people discussed the ups and downs of recently released video games. Anything would do.</p>
<p>The second part of the job took place in London. Rising at dawn, I traveled up to Charing Cross in the old slam-door train carriages and watched in silent despair as the City drew ever closer. The country office might have been unapologetically quiet and slow, but the City was numbingly, achingly boring. I longed for someone to talk to, someone who was even remotely inclined to escape the world of banking. Inevitably I would find myself isolated in a seminar that focused on the workings of debit systems and direct payment pipelines. I would stand up, say my name and that of my employer, and then attempt to avoid speaking for the next four or five hours. I carefully filled my notepads with poorly understood jottings. As a graduate, I had assumed that I wanted to be a journalist of some kind, but I clearly wasn’t coping with this. What should have been tight, insightful reporting ended up being vague, impressionistic, often unusable information. The world of finance remained a forbidding mystery, and the stack of John Kenneth Galbraith books by my bedside wasn’t doing much to kindle my enthusiasm for economics either.</p>
<p>But there was something else going on in my life that ran parallel—almost contrary—to my suit-and-tie day job: a kind of double life. During my spare moments, I was submerged in a different activity, one in which I was completely at home. It was a video game called <span class="rend-i">Quake III Arena.</span> Gaming was a daily release, a few hours of energy and color to counterbalance my career in corporate tedium. With a cup of tea and late-1990s soundtrack (Britpop with a smattering of electronica), I launched myself into evenings of gleeful acrobatics. A torrent of explosions and power-ups vigorously erased the memories of boredom.</p>
<p>The <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> games are the direct descendants of that most notorious of modern video games, <span class="rend-i">Doom.</span> They are combat games set in a first-person perspective and filled with the latest in spectacular graphic effects. You control your character directly, seeing things from his or her perspective, shooting when you hit the trigger button, and picking up weapons and ammunition as you move. These games seem straightforward and approachable, since they are so close to how we experience things in real life—you run around, see things from the character’s point of view, and so on. Yet the experience of <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> and its kin can be baffling for anyone who hasn’t already sunk hours into mastering them. Beginners find themselves in a state of confusion, unable to avoid looking at the floor or the ceiling for extended periods. Bumping into walls, unable to aim, or finding yourself obliterated by your enemies—the list of frustrations grows by the second. And they are all due to a dastardly control system that expects you to maneuver a keyboard and mouse in unison (or two thumbsticks when playing on a gamepad)—no small feat for any novice. Then there’s all the arcane rites involved in using a desktop PC to play games: install the patches, update the drivers, tweak the gizmometer… . This kind of gaming doesn’t make itself easy, and it’s tough to get yourself up to speed. Of course, anyone could, theoretically, pick up and play these games; yet, like riding a bike or driving a car, they’ll need a guiding hand to get out on the road. At weekends and during spare evenings, I was such a guiding hand.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> has the capacity to connect to “hosted” games on the Internet. This means that a dozen or so people can connect to a server and fight each other remotely from the comfort of attics, offices, and bedrooms across the world. They can make up ad hoc teams or simply run amok, blasting each other with rocket launchers and lightning guns. I played on these online servers for countless hours, chatting away, fighting, learning new techniques. In fact, the days and weeks I poured into playing this single game meant that I had become unnervingly precise. I soon played at a level that combined detailed knowledge of the game’s workings with acute learned reflexes. To those who had just started playing, this kind of play seemed almost superhuman. The experienced few used weapon physics to fly up walls or demonstrated innate spatial awareness that defied tactical expectations of less experienced players. Landing a missile right on top of an enemy without having seen him for several minutes, just because you <span class="rend-i">knew</span> he would be right there, right then, became a routine experience. It was considered a great honor to be accused of cheating. How else indeed could anyone play a game with this kind of proficiency?</p>
<p>Being accused of cheating wasn’t enough for me though, and I began to desire some kind of greater recognition for my dedication. I realized I could get something more out of the time I had invested: I could start my own team. Toward the end of the 1990s, games like <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> had become popular as competitive enterprises. Amateur teams played (and still play) scheduled matches over the Internet. Online leagues blossomed, and net-based communities were formed to help run the events. These communities provided servers for the online games and orchestrated league structures for the players to battle it out. I had already been involved in one casual online team while playing the <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> clone <span class="rend-i">Kingpin,</span> which had a theme of 1920s gang violence. So when <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> was released in 1999, I decided to enter these new gladiatorial arenas with my own squad.</p>
<p>My initial recruitment plan consisted of simply talking to other players. Many of them had only ever played a few video games in their lifetime, having found the predictability and solitary focus of single-player games off-putting. But they experienced the online game as a revelation. Here was something more akin to a sport, with real spectators yelling hints from the sidelines and an army of human-controlled talent to show you how it was done. This human element transformed gaming for my players, and they each experienced minor epiphanies as they joined up with other, distant gamers for five-a-side <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> games of “capture the flag.” “It was like exercising a new limb,” recalled one gamer I spoke to about that time. “I was suddenly practicing and arranging matches every other night, as if I was in a pub footie team—even though no football team would ever have me!”</p>
<p>I knew how he felt. Cold mornings, adolescent disinterest, and a nagging hip injury had meant that I was banished from the sports field for many years. I wasn’t going to be able to indulge in the camaraderie that sports teams felt or in the extended buzz of victory through dedication and cooperation. That entire swathe of experience had been cut off from me by cruel circumstance and a good dose of self-defeating apathy. Now, however, there was a possibility for some kind of redemption: a sport for the quick-fingered and the computer-bound; a space of possibility in which I could mold friends and strangers into a proficient gaming team.</p>
<p>And so I ran trials of sorts and trained players in how best to use <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span>’s many weapons. The first few sign-ups came from one-on-one duels, which, by their nature, meant you usually got talking with the other person. Usually the conversations were with someone whose native language was Russian or Portuguese, so the experience was often bizarre, occasionally awkward, but sometimes fruitful and friendly. After a few good fights and swapped instant messenger names, the founding team members began to appear. My extensive reading of <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> forums and fan Web sites (combined with seemingly endless practice) meant that I could rapidly improve the averages of my new players. I showed them how setting the mouse pointer to a slower speed improved their accuracy and how the in-game graphics could be stripped down and reduced to create a smoother, clearer experience. It was like fine-tuning a car, only I had figured out how it all worked through Web sites, forum posts, and some reverse engineering of game files.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, things in the world of financial journalism lurched along in an uneven fashion. My poor performance had been noted, and I knew that the situation was a downward spiral. I dreaded the 6 a.m. starts that would land me in central London, and I longed to get back to my increasingly successful foray into team gaming. The discussions about corporate finance inexorably turned into indecipherable droning as my brain reduced the non-<span class="rend-i">Quake</span> signal to static. I plodded on, trying not to draw attention to the idle creaking of my expensive chair. I did what I could but began to receive fewer and fewer assignments. I was worried. I felt doomed.</p>
<p>The team, meanwhile, had just signed its essential star player. A natural talent and an astute tactician, he gave the team a vital edge. Almost a year after signing him, I met this prodigy at a games weekend in a small town in Devon. Paul was accompanied by his brother-in-law. He was an unassuming IT technician with a receding hairline. He had an expensive car and … , well, there’s no accounting for people’s taste in pop music. I think it’s fair to say that we didn’t really connect, but that didn’t ultimately matter. Our shared interest in competitive <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> was all that we needed to worry about. The team needed Paul, and for at least a short time, Paul needed the team, too.</p>
<p>During that time, we entered competitions and even won a few prizes for participating in the demonstration matches that were shown on the early Internet TV station Network of the World. We knew that we could never beat the best that Europe had to offer, but our game nevertheless rose to the point where we began to hold our own against the lower echelons of the top few thousand <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> players. Even our casual play was now far from casual: we examined everything, analyzed every move in hour-long discussions after the games. I was by now an utterly obsessed player-coach. I arranged practice schedules and sparring teams to meet us on private servers. I watched recordings of famous matches, especially those featuring teams we were about to face. I filtered everything back to my players: game configurations that might give us an advantage, tactics that would give us the edge, player formations that might give my team members a split-second drop on their opponents. What my team lacked in raw skill with a rocket launcher they would make up for in preparation, computing finesse, and insider knowledge. I was delighted when I managed to snare top-class players and distraught when we weren’t deemed talented enough to be worth their time. I constantly nursed egos in private chat rooms, trying to field the best team while at the same time giving everyone a go. “Honestly, Crazy Joe, you’re a fine player, but the others turned up for more practice sessions …”</p>
<p>I cracked down on unsporting smack talk, gave (supposedly) rousing speeches (sometimes typed, then later over Internet voice communications), and played occasional Cupid between the extremely shy woman who had joined the team and the extremely shy man whom she clearly intended to hit on. We struggled, we played, we won, and we lost. We clawed our way up through the divisions. Each victory was a euphoric celebration, each loss a crippling disaster.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>On the train to London, meanwhile, I routinely passed a placard advertising some kind of telephone help line. It asked me, in bright yellow-on-pink letters, “Are you cracking up?” I looked down at the frayed edges of my notebook and wondered how long all this could go on. How long could I hold down a job when my mind was lost in gaming? Was I lying to myself about even trying to be a journalist?</p>
<p>Soon thereafter the crucial moment came to pass. My manager, Richard, sat me down and fixed me with a clouded look. He had, he assumed, some bad news: “We’re going to have to let you go.”</p>
<p>The hallelujah chorus sounded. I felt the rush of sudden freedom: now there was nothing between me and pure indulgence. I could concentrate on the team seven days a week, without interruption, without tortuous journeys into the heart of finance. It was a moment of thrilling emancipation. I plunged into it, headfirst, playing for long days and late nights. Dawn was a familiar sight at bedtime. The team grew and became more cohesive. We found like-minded teams to spar with, allowing my players to grow more confident. Soon they could play <span class="rend-i">and</span> win.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my attempts to secure new employment were infrequent. Stacks of unprocessed job advertisements grew on either side of my desk, and my savings dwindled. Games refused to pay the bills, and I would eventually have to make a genuine effort to look for full-time employment. I made a few sullen forays to industrial parks and office blocks, and I even began to learn simple programming languages, but unbeknownst to me at the time, my break had already arrived. I had, thanks to the insistence of some friends, applied for a position on a games magazine. I expected nothing, didn’t care, and told the interviewers much of the story you’ve been reading here. They conferred, unsure. Unsurprisingly I didn’t get the job. But I did later receive a call asking whether I could possibly write something that would help the magazine’s readers play a little better. I said I probably could and wondered if they could help me avoid having to return to London and the worrying question on the pink and yellow billboard. The answer was yes.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="2.1.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Bleeping and Zapping</span></h4>
<p>Video games changed my life. It’s a pleasing convenience to be able to pinpoint a moment, or at least a period of time, that enables me to chart the change so precisely. Thanks to my <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> expertise, I was soon in a full-time job that didn’t have anything to do with corporate treasury issues or early morning meetings in bank seminar rooms. It was a radical shift both professionally and personally, and it was almost entirely unexpected. After all, games might have been crucial to my day-to-day identity, but I had never admitted as much to myself. They were a distraction, an excellent waste of time. They had no specific value, and I never expected my obsession to pay the rent and focus my entire career.</p>
<p>As a games journalist, I went on to meet plenty of other people whose lives have been changed, defined—perhaps even saved—by gaming. Many of the gamers I’ve met have been involved directly in the games industry, but others are simply people for whom gaming is a continuous presence in their lives. Games have catalyzed major changes for some of these people, as they did for me. But they usually change us in subtler ways. These subtler effects have only begun to be mapped by researchers, commentators, and gamers. Sometimes the effects seem to be negative: people so distracted that they lose sight of their responsibilities—ignoring jobs, families, and everyday lives. Other times they are positive—stimulating intellectual and personal growth or awakening unrealized ambitions in creative minds. Gaming seems to be neither wholly positive nor entirely negative: its value (or lack thereof) is indistinct and undefined. Perhaps more critically still, many people lack the conceptual vocabulary to describe games in a positive way at all. One of the most routine complaints in the games industry is “My parents/partner/peers still don’t believe I have a proper job.” It’s not just that many people don’t take gaming seriously, they don’t know how to take it seriously. And why would they, if their only experience of it was a drunken game of <span class="rend-i">NHL Hockey</span> after a night out at a singles bar or the weird Japanese cartoon creatures that a younger brother or sister seems to care so much about?</p>
<p>I am going to try to persuade you here that games are worth paying attention to. They are worth taking seriously and thinking and talking about in some detail. They might even be a very good thing for our culture as a whole. But what is most important to my analysis is the fact of video games’ ambiguous social value: they’re beloved by gamers and derided or dismissed by the uninitiated. Of course, I might not be able to resolve that ambiguity, but I do intend to offer snapshots of gaming life that will make it a little clearer why gamers themselves value games—or at least some games—to the extent they do.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>My generation is the first to live their entire lives in the company of electronic, interactive entertainment. We see the TV as a facilitator of rhythm-action rapping games as much as a way to tune into the daily news. Our expectations of what a game should be are defined not by sports, chess, or a deck of cards but by gamepads, plasma screens, and motion sensors. Our cultural backdrop is defined by exposure to a constantly evolving repertoire of technologies, technology that seems to stake out new territory for itself with each passing month: we do not expect things to stay the same. We expect newness and change. Video games represent some of the most sophisticated computing and programming technologies available: a supercomputer in every home and a complex networking gaming platform on every mobile phone. It’s a technology that we expect to evolve. Games get prettier, faster, louder, and more expensive. Yet today’s consumers experience this rapid evolution of electronic gaming as just another element of everyday life, as commonplace as TV shows, Italian food, or shopping.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many of the gamers I encounter report the same experience of feeling as if they have engaged in some kind of transgression. There’s often a sense of guilt that comes with tales of gaming exploits, as if games were a vice or a character flaw, a symptom of one kind or another. I began to take note of these reports and often found myself wondering what it was that people were really doing when they were playing video games: was it an obsession with pretty colors or with sheer novelty? Was it something deeper? Were people getting anything worthwhile out of games at all? Some researchers have begun to examine this question in some detail. Work carried out by psychologist Richard Wood and his colleagues at Nottingham Trent University included an online questionnaire in which gamers answered questions about their habits. A majority reported that they felt as if they were “wasting time” playing games, and yet most of them were hard pressed to identify what else they should have been doing with that time. Reading a book, perhaps? That was one popular answer.</p>
<p>I asked Henry Jenkins, the smiling, bearded codirector of the MIT Comparative Media Studies program, why he thought so many gamers gave this kind of response. Jenkins observed that many activities can be engaged with productively or unproductively and that games were no exception—a lot of the gamers probably <span class="rend-i">were</span> wasting their time by playing games. Yet there was another force at work here, one that he was keen to identify: “Most of us are overscheduled and overburdened with other aspects of our lives, and it ought to be a sacred thing to sometimes goof off with our mates,” said Jenkins. “But I think the issue goes deeper than that. We lack ways of justifying or explaining the value of games as a meaningful form of activity. They are under fire from all sides. Most people treat them as debased and unproductive. And we start to feel guilty because we internalize some of those perceptions and descriptions.”</p>
<p>I believe that the nature of those “perceptions and descriptions” is an important part of identifying what it means to be a gamer and how that identity could—and perhaps should—change. Games, particularly in the West, have been identified with a nerdy subculture and still carry negative social connotations. In some cases, games are actively vilified. The British parliamentarian Boris Johnson described the effects of video games like this: “The nippers [children] are bleeping and zapping in speechless rapture, their passive faces washed in explosions and gore. They sit for so long that their souls seem to have been sucked down the cathode-ray tube. They become like blinking lizards, motionless, absorbed, only the twitching of their hands showing they are still conscious. These machines teach them nothing. They stimulate no ratiocination, discovery, or feat of memory.”</p>
<p>Jon Henshaw, the editor of parenting Web site Family Resource.com, offers a similar, if somewhat less sensational, description of what gamers are doing: “Instead of taking a trip, mountain biking, or hanging out with friends at a café, gamers spend their time in a virtual reality. Whereas real-life experiences bear long-lasting friendships and memories, video games do not. The only pictures that come from video games are screenshots, and the memories that are created from playing those games are ultimately meaningless.”</p>
<p>Could the experience of gaming really be “meaningless”? It’s a given that many games (like many books or films) are badly made and trashy, but are the souls of gamers actually suffering under the glare of this digital menace? My own life was changed for the better thanks to the expertise I gleaned through habitual gaming, but it seems clear to me that there’s something else to be earned from the act itself, something positive about simply spending a few hours a week playing games. The gamers I meet aren’t vacant-eyed zombies or “blinking lizards.” They (usually) have smiles on their faces, and they express lively opinions on what they’ve seen on many different types of gaming screens. So my cards are on the table: I’m going to offer some alternative, positive descriptions. This analysis will show how video games have inspired artists, transformed rags into riches, given purpose to empty lives, and entertained bored people on a Sunday afternoon. We’ll see how games turned young people into heroes and how gaming has enabled the realization of previously unimaginable ambitions. We’ll see how games can make us better people, how they dissolve the horrors of boredom—and how they can function as propaganda for a wide range of worthy and unworthy causes.</p>

<a name="2.1.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Monster Returning</span></h4>
<p>Despite a deluge of positive images of hip, popular gamers since Disney’s <span class="rend-i">Tron</span> in 1982, games in the media have long been dogged by negative descriptions. Games are routinely associated with “youth in crisis,” and stories about obesity or falling educational scores are often illustrated by stock footage of gamers at play. Like other forms of new media before them (pulp fiction, comics, rock and roll, film, TV), games have been portrayed as harmful, morally and socially. And they seem to be particularly hazardous to the mental and physical health of the young. Yet in years of reporting on games, I’ve uncovered little evidence for such claims; nor is this supposed degradation evident in my own life or in the lives of the people around me. (Was I really fired because of an obsession with a game, or was I simply in the wrong job?) </p>
<p>I’m going to supply some unambiguously positive descriptions of gaming and of gamers that I hope will, among other things, enable gamers to identify the value in their pastime and, ultimately, find even more productive and meaningful ways of engaging with it. Most of the time, of course, we will be simply “goofing off” playing <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto,</span> but perhaps gamers and others will eventually be able to see that, too, as sacred.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>One gamer for whom fresh descriptions of gaming are nothing new is the experimental installation artist Brody Condon. He creates artworks that are influenced as much by his video game experiences as by the emotional and social traumas that he feels define him as a human being. His work offers strange visions of gamelike figures: a computerized Elvis toting an AK-47, a thousand consecutive deaths of video game characters, a battle of performance art in an LA gallery, a sculpture of a famous game developer as he appears inside his own game.</p>
<p>Like many other gamers, Condon feels that much of his own personality has been shaped by gaming: “I was born the same year <span class="rend-i">SpaceWar</span> was created. I was the juvenile delinquent at the local arcades before they disappeared. I took over [role-playing sessions] if our usual Saturday afternoon scenario creator, a Presbyterian minister and religious school vice principal who still lived with his mother, was sick. I subscribed to <span class="rend-i">Nintendo Power Magazine.</span> Floppy disks came in the mail. I dressed up in fantasy armor and beat my friends over the head with sticks and foam. I sat in a closet in front of a hand-me-down TI-99 and programmed text-based adventure games that I would lose as soon as I turned the damn thing off. I was ‘the kid that could beat any game’ at my shitty public school.”</p>
<p>These experiences provided Condon with his unique visual language when he eventually studied art. Games gave him a way of working that was all his own and, in doing so, enabled the artist to create himself. “These days, whenever I meet actual game developers or speak at game conferences, I feel like a kind of Frankenstein,” explained Condon as he talked to me about the connection between games and his art. “I’ve been playing their games my whole life, you know? And here I am, like the monster returning to the master that created it, arms outstretched, mumbling, ‘Give my life meaning.’”</p>
<p>Condon, like most artists, takes his cues from the world he is presented with, and much of that world consists of video games. If games have value here, it’s in providing Condon with a focus and language for his work and the inspiration to create it. What Condon does is recognized as art in the gallery sense, with its visually striking juxtapositions and video game materials presented out of context. In fact, game-related video installations and multimedia constructs have long been a part of gallery-level exhibitions, and the visual concepts supplied by games have been embraced by dozens of contemporary artists. But games and art nevertheless maintain an uneasy relationship. And in my opinion, the question of whether games themselves can be art in the same way that, say, sculpture and portraiture can occasionally overshadows the fact that games are used by people like Condon for highly creative and innovative purposes. This question has generated long, overwrought, often tortuous debate and has been hotly contested by gamers, academics, and critics of all kinds. Like the value of games generally, the value of games as art is indistinct, unresolved, and notoriously messy.</p>
<p>Once again the thoughts of Professor Henry Jenkins are illuminating, this time on the subject of why games have had to struggle for the same status as other expressive media: “We might ask where the resistance is coming from. It is coming from partisans of other arts. It comes from film critics who are worried that their preferred medium is going to be superseded. It is coming from literary critics who are concerned that young people are playing games rather than reading books. It comes from those whose notion of art is so narrow that very few works qualify, as opposed to those of us who have a fairly expansive notion of art and are willing to welcome in new aesthetic experiences. It comes from gamers who worry that calling games art means that they are going to become too obscure and pretentious (small danger there, guys). It has to do with our totally messed up notion of what constitutes art.”</p>
<p>For the purposes of this text, I think that the issue of whether games constitute art can be safely ignored. I think this partly because there are so many other reasons to value games and partly because, as Condon insists, “the question of what is considered art (or not art) hasn’t been relevant since 1929, when Duchamp put a urinal on the wall.” Condon argues: “It is about context. Call it art, whatever it is, and I will accept it and will discuss it as such.” I feel the same way.</p>
<p>The reason for arguing that games—at least some games—deserve to be classified as art is that it offers gamers a more positive, culturally sanctioned way to describe what they do. It suggests that games are not mere trivia. It also enables us to place a higher value on—to elevate—what game developers do. Just as the term <span class="rend-i">art</span> suggests that strolling through a gallery isn’t just time spent staring at passing walls, it would also suggest that gaming involves more than twitching in front of a monitor.</p>

<a name="2.1.4"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Ghost Patterns</span></h4>
<p>Games—like films, books, sports, and other cultural activities—cater to deep emotional, intellectual, and sensual needs. Gamers buy games not simply because they’re fine pieces of art or even well-programmed pieces of software but because they produce significant physical and emotional responses. The abstract satisfaction of deleting a row of <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> blocks, the heart-quickening thrill of a snowboarding simulation—these are the reasons we play games. The responses produced by games vary endlessly in their qualities, but their existence and their significance is undeniable. My task, and the task that others have begun to take upon themselves, is to find out what value the responses that games produce in us really have. How do games affect us? How does playing a video game change the person who plays it?</p>
<p>Steven Johnson’s popular book-length thought experiment <span class="rend-i">Everything Bad Is Good for You</span> begins its exploration of the beneficial effects of playing games by pointing out that games, far from being slothful indulgence, are usually formidable undertakings. “The first and last thing that should be said about the experience of playing today’s video games, the thing that you almost never hear in mainstream coverage, is that games are fiendishly, sometimes maddeningly, <span class="rend-i">hard.</span>” Johnson spotted what I knew from playing <span class="rend-i">Quake III,</span> which is that games present us with unusual, often intractable problems. We do not sit back in our armchairs and passively digest them—we puzzle over them, wrestle with them, and defeat them.</p>
<p>The intellectual value of video games, Johnson argues, has to do with the fact that they aren’t explicit about their rules. Unlike a traditional game, such as chess, where the rules are fully spelled out in advance, you have to uncover the rules of individual video games as you go along. Most computer games are nonexplicit “fuzzy” experiences. “You have to probe the depths of the game’s logic to make sense of it,” says Johnson, “and like most probing expeditions you get results by trial and error, by stumbling across things, by following hunches.” Johnson suggests that this process of “probing” is a complex learned activity that is analogous to the scientific method. This assertion is seconded by Professor Stephen Heppell of the University of East Anglia, who writes in “Unlimited Learning”: “My own research work has revealed that a very clear set of strategies has evolved by children playing computer games. To succeed in even the simplest platform game, children have to lock their problem solving into a tight cycle of observe, question, hypothesize, test. Curiously, this exactly matches the scientific method that education has been trying to embed in young scientists since the birth of science.”</p>
<p>Video games are more about how you play them than about their fancy explosions or even their characters and stories. What motivates the mushroom people is infinitely less important than learning how to run, jump, and open treasure chests. During video game play, we engage in processes of gradual, often rather complex experimentation. These processes uncover rules about the game world that we can use again in other situations. The players who realized that every firearm recoil pattern in the game <span class="rend-i">Counter-Strike</span> was the same suddenly had a supernatural understanding of the physics of their game world: what should have been random suddenly had a pattern that could be understood and predicted. Every single round from an automatic weapon could be anticipated.</p>
<p>However, unlike the scientific method, much of what gamers learn is outside conscious awareness. As we play, we internalize various rules and discover methods, often relying on them because they occasionally reap rewards or because they just happen to feel like the right thing to do in the game world. Thanks to months of playing <span class="rend-i">Quake III,</span> I learned instinctively that by hitting certain keys as my <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> character jumped, I could travel farther. As it happened, this had been specifically designed into the game, but I only realized I was doing it when, months later, I read about the concept of “strafe jumping.” Someone else, long before, realized he could get to a high ledge by jumping on the explosion from a rocket. The blast wouldn’t be enough to kill him, but the inertia would be enough to propel him higher and faster than mere leaping. This technique now arrives almost subliminally for <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> players, but rocket jumping has long been recognized as one of <span class="rend-i">Quake</span>’s key skills.</p>
<p>Another example of unconscious, practical learning from <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> is that of leading your shots. When playing in an online game, the signal from your “snapshot” of the game has to bounce from your computer to the remote computer on which the gaming is being hosted and back again. This means that where your game draws your enemy and where the server thinks he is might be slightly out of sync. Shooting slightly ahead of where you see him allows players to counter that. Many <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> players learned to do this without even being able to explicitly identify it as a tactic. It simply felt right.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the potential for something more complicated, beyond “probing” and beyond unconscious mastery of a gun that shoots lightning bolts. This is a process that Steven Johnson defines as “telescoping.” Telescoping refers to the way that gamers have to deal with multiple objectives, each one resting inside the next like the concentric rings in a telescope. Johnson uses the example of a <span class="rend-i">Zelda</span> game in which the ultimate objective is to rescue your sister. To complete this core objective, players engage in continuous management of layer after layer of secondary and tertiary objectives. Each one must be completed before other tasks are possible. For Link, the main character in <span class="rend-i">Zelda,</span> killing an enemy so that he can cross a bridge requires that he have a weapon. Having a weapon requires that he complete the weapon quest, completing the weapon quest means speaking to the fairy, speaking to the fairy means accessing the map, and so on and so forth. Gamers have to be able to juggle all this and understand which objectives to sideline and when to do so, if they are to get closer to their overall goal. Johnson’s thesis is that this kind of layered play develops our abilities to cope with the chaotic storm of information that constitutes modern living. Games are so hard, so complex, that we reap huge cognitive rewards by learning to overcome them. “Information overload” isn’t such a problem for those people who have taken lessons from gaming, says Johnson.</p>
<p>A growing body of scientific study supports Johnson’s claims. A report published in October 2006 by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) concluded that contemporary educational systems lacked the capacity to assess the kinds of skills that video games taught, meaning that they ultimately went undetected. Additionally, the FAS paper concluded: “Video game developers have instinctively implemented many of the common axioms of learning scientists. They have used these approaches to help game players exercise a skill set closely matching the thinking, planning, learning, and technical skills increasingly demanded by employers in a wide range of industries.”</p>
<p>The range of cognitive skills found to benefit from time spent gaming continues to widen. Researchers at the University of Rochester in New York have been examining the plasticity of human visual processing by using video gamers as test subjects. The Rochester team wanted to see whether habitual game playing improved visual skills, and their report explained that “video game players were found to outperform non-video game players on the localization of an eccentric target among distractors, on the number of visual items they could apprehend at once, and on the fast temporal processing of visual information.” This kind of research—the cognitive neuroscience of video games—has only recently been undertaken, but it is nevertheless a rapidly expanding subject. The work so far performed in the field has consistently demonstrated that habitual gamers tend to have improved spatial cognitive skills, enhanced visual attention, and the ability to process multiple tasks with greater efficiency. Games, it seems, change gamers’ brains for the better.</p>

<a name="2.1.5"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Nintendo Surgeon</span></h4>
<p>It seems that gamers are learning new techniques for managing information. Academic studies have begun to illustrate that video game principles go hand in hand with new ways of learning. The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) wants to show us that games can help in other, more formal places, too—particularly in schools.</p>
<p>ELSPA has made numerous attempts to provide due credit for the activities of its members. An example of this is their 2006 paper “Unlimited Learning,” which set out to highlight how games fit into the overall process of learning and education in schools. The paper lists dozens of ex-amples in which games have been used as teaching aids and learning tools. It shows that games give us the capacity to teach in ways that were previously out of reach. We could imagine, for example, a board game or pen-and-paper role-playing games based on running a school, but when you add to this a computer, 3-D planning systems, and the ability to control real-time calculations of costs as they will be encountered in the real world, you suddenly have something both accessible to children and complex enough to teach adult ideas. </p>
<p>One U.K. school, in Birmingham, opted for an approach that melded exactly these kinds of ideas. A contributor to the ELSPA report explained how it worked: “We were originally going to use <span class="rend-i">SimCity 4</span> but thought it too detailed for the 1.5 hours we had the children. <span class="rend-i">School Tycoon</span> [a commercial product] allowed us to get the children to develop their spatial thinking skills, fiscal skills, numeracy, and even social awareness. Many did not realize the jobs that are entailed in running a school and how essential they are. The pupils were given cards to make their own ‘physical’ school within a budget and were then shown the software. They were allowed to play in the ‘sandbox’ mode for an hour and then we print-screened the final school with financial and academic results to determine who had been successful.” Approaches like the <span class="rend-i">School Tycoon</span> project allow students to benefit from the graphic, illustrative qualities of gaming systems, while at the same time learning to work with physical models and practical mathematical systems. Better still, being good with games is something that kids want to demonstrate to their peers.</p>
<p>Another teacher, Tim Rylands, used an adapted version of the game <span class="rend-i">Myst</span> as a teaching aid in classes of children 7–11 years old. The game improved literacy because of its text focus and its comparative “cool.” The appeal of playing a video game to the children meant that they maintained attention longer than they would have done with a book, even though the amount of text delivered was similar. Using the game also had other social effects for the class, because it was played by committee rather than through solo decision making. One of the students had this to say about her experience: “The most difficult thing about using <span class="rend-i">Myst</span> at first was having to make decisions as a group to solve the problems. We needed to learn a lot of negotiation skills so that we could work our way towards the solutions together. It’s fun to talk about where you have got up to in the game and how to solve different problems.” In this case, gaming was not simply a cognitive exercise or cerebral puzzle, it was a social conundrum that children were forced to resolve through discussion and cooperation.</p>
<p>In many ways, of course, these examples are really nothing new. We’ve known for a long time that the process of play is crucial to the development of all greater mammals, particularly humans. Studies with developing animals have consistently shown that creatures who have been deprived of suitable play suffer from developmental problems. Psychologist Diane Ackerman’s 2000 book on the development of human beings, <span class="rend-i">Deep Play,</span> has this to say about our most vital method of learning: “Play is an activity enjoyed for its own sake. It is our brain’s favorite way of learning and maneuvering. Because we think of play as the opposite of seriousness, we don’t notice that it governs most of society… . even in its least intoxicating forms, play feels satisfying, absorbing, and has rules and a life of its own, while offering rare challenges. It is organic to who and what we are, a process as instinctive as breathing.” We learn through infantile roughhousing, we learn through adventures with our toys, and some of us learned secondary-level French by playing pirated adventure games. Whatever the particulars, there’s no way to deny its significance. Video games are rapidly becoming a dominant and useful form of play: now we have to understand why that is and what it means.</p>
<p>If schoolchildren can learn from the inherent playfulness of video games, then so, surely, can U.S. marines. In early 2006, the University of California’s Information Sciences Institute developed a learning suite called <span class="rend-i">Tactical Iraqi,</span> with the aim of teaching soldiers how to interact successfully with Iraqi civilians. The system was based on familiar video game conventions: a first-person point of view, a menu of options for character behavior, and so on. The system taught spoken as well as body language, allowing soldiers to experiment in a safe environment and learn the best way to approach social situations with the people they were going to be policing on a daily basis. Allowing soldiers to work and practice at their own computer terminal wasn’t just convenient for military instructors, it was also (reportedly) intuitive to a generation of soldiers who had grown up with video games.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has explained that video games were “necessary and natural” for training. Nevertheless, there is no evidence whatsoever that games have a causal link to violence or that gamers are less inhibited about using weapons, as some U.S. military officials have suggested. All such claims have, so far, been groundless and often transparently motivated by ulterior concerns. (I’m a <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> genius and I can’t hit a clay pigeon with a 12 gauge.) Personally, I regard projects like <span class="rend-i">Tactical Iraqi</span> as positive for gamers, even if the politics of that particular project seem dubious and even if military officials do harbor hopes that games will teach their charges how to destroy people with multimillion-dollar attack helicopters.</p>
<p>I do not want to diminish the idea that games are good for hand-eye coordination. There are plenty of reasons to believe that playing video games increases proficiency with technological interfaces and improves general “twitch” skills, and the importance of this should not be understated. Our interaction with electronic and mechanical devices becomes ever more important as the technological level of society rises. One crucial example of the relation of games to this phenomenon comes from the work performed by New York surgeon Dr. James Rosser. An exponent of “minimally invasive surgery” and an experienced medical practitioner, Rosser seems about as far from artist Brody Condon as you might care to imagine. Yet both are gamers who have made something positive from their time spent with games. Both men have applied what they learned from games to their professional lives. Games helped Condon find his mode of artistic expression; Rosser used them to improve the coordination and dexterity of his trainee surgeons. Rosser insists that playing on a Nintendo console is as essential a part of the success of his Top Gun training program as more traditional exercises. Surgeons who played at least three hours of <span class="rend-i">Super Monkey Ball</span> each week made 37 percent fewer errors, according to Rosser. Games weren’t optional or trivial for this surgeon: they were mandatory. “You have to be a Nintendo surgeon,” he told <span class="rend-i">Wired</span> magazine.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="2.1.6"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Electronic Antidote</span></h4>
<p>Computerization has transformed our idea of what constitutes a game. The Copenhagen-based gaming academic Jesper Juul argues that the computer stands to the medium of gaming as the printing press stands to the medium of writing. Until the printing press was invented, the written word only had a limited set of applications; likewise, games were previously limited to boards, cards, or verbal play. Now, thanks to computing technologies, their application and potential seems unlimited, and they could scarcely be more different in their content and themes: contrast <span class="rend-i">Robotron</span> and <span class="rend-i">Oblivion</span> or <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> and <span class="rend-i">Blast Corps.</span> Video games represent a previously unimagined terrain for play, one that is almost impossible to survey with any authority. A critic of games journalism recently asked, “Where is the Lester Bangs of games journalism?” And a chorus of gamers responded, “Where is the man who has time to play even a fraction of the games out there?” In just 40 years, the concept of gaming has exploded into a wide palette of gaming experience. The possibilities for play—and learning through play—are gradually opening up new ground (as well as meticulously retreading successful ideas over and over). They are also ushering in some pleasing, constructive trends. Still, I am far from thinking that laudable ends, such as learning and education, are the most important possibilities that have been opened up by the proliferation and evolution of gaming. In fact, though those are positive things, what is most valuable to me about computerized play is the fact that it offers new and far greater possibilities for being entertained.</p>
<p>This claim, of course, brings us full circle back to a more conventional idea of what games are: namely, that they’re fun ways to pass time. Sure, they improve reaction-based skills—skills that are often transferable and demonstrable, as Dr. Rosser believes them to be. And they might just make us better soldiers or students. But that’s not their main function. In some cases, they might even make us smarter, as Steven Johnson suggests, by improving such cognitive skills as information handling and problem solving. But let’s not lose sight of their core value: games are an antidote to boredom, an excellent cure for a seriously debilitating malaise.</p>
<p>I believe that boredom is a far greater problem than most people are willing to acknowledge. This lack of acknowledgment may reflect the fact that boredom is so closely associated with idleness that many people find it hard to believe that someone might be bored for legitimate reasons. Boredom is frequently dismissed as a personal failing. But that’s simply not the case. Boredom is often a result of circumstance rather than a general lack of enterprise. A person will often be bored by something. We often find ourselves at a motivational loss or without the means to keep our minds suitably occupied—think of the importance of a toy to a child whose family is visiting the antique realm of an elderly relative or the significance of a book or mobile phone when stranded in the experiential desert of an international airport. We all experience boredom at some time or other, although some of us are more resistant to it than others. It seems safe to say that avoiding boredom is important to almost everyone, and some of us have developed complex strategies for expunging it completely. Perhaps one of the crucial reasons why boredom is so ignored is that it is gone and forgotten when it is resolved. Unlike melancholy or alienation, boredom is utterly transient and intangible. It is so nebulous and vague that philosophers and psychologists despair of coming to grips with it in any meaningful or helpful way.</p>
<p>My personal familiarity with the agonies of boredom drove me to think about it in more depth, but I initially understood little about the condition. Boredom remains elusive to almost anyone you might talk to—even the literature of boredom is notably uninformative and thin. Most of my own understanding of it derives from a book called <span class="rend-i">A Philosophy of Boredom,</span> by the Norwegian philosophy professor Lars Svendsen. This unassuming little tome, first published in 2005, strikes deep at the heart of the concept, identifying trends within boredom, strains of boredom, and the relationship between boredom and modern life. Until you take some time to consider boredom as a significant and complex subject, as Svendsen does, it might not seem particularly significant. The more we delve, however, the more we see how broad the problem is. Svendsen, too, notes that boredom is one of the least well-studied aspects of human life, despite widespread reference to its consequences throughout philosophy and literature. Being less romantic than other maladies of the soul, boredom has been relatively neglected by humanists and scientists.</p>
<p>What is clear is that use of the term <span class="rend-i">boredom</span> has increased ceaselessly since the eighteenth century. It cannot be found in English before 1760, and although Svendsen notes that some European languages came up with equivalent words in the centuries before, they were generally der-ivations of the Latin for “hate” and carried similar meanings. Usage of the term in its contemporary sense nevertheless increased steadily from the late eighteenth century, and by 1932, boredom had come to denote something genuinely worth worrying about, as Svendsen cites Bertrand Russell’s thoughts on the matter: “Boredom as a factor in human behavior has received, in my opinion, far less attention than it deserves. It has, I believe, been one of the motive powers through the historical epoch, and it is so at the present day more than ever.” Boredom, it seems, is not a new problem, but it is one of peculiar concern to modern humans.</p>
<p>Svendsen also quotes Fernando Pessoa, who identifies boredom as “the feeling that there’s nothing worth doing.” The bored are those people for whom no activity seems satisfactory. The problem is often not that there is a lack of things to do in general but, rather, that there is a lack of things that are worthwhile. Boredom can arise in all kinds of situations, but it usually makes itself known when we cannot do what we want to do or when we must do something we do not wish to do or something we cannot find a satisfactory reason for. “Boredom is not a question of idleness,” suggests Svendsen, “but of meaning.” Boredom does not, however, equate to the kind of meaninglessness found in depression. The bored are not necessarily unhappy with life; they are simply unfulfilled by circumstances, activities, and the things around them.</p>
<p>In my experience, gamers are rarely bored when they have access to their hobby. (And many are deeply bored when disconnected from it.) Obviously games do not provide a solution for everyone, but could they be the gamer’s antidote to boredom and therefore meaninglessness? Could the end-in-itself of mastering <span class="rend-i">Pac-Man</span> or <span class="rend-i">Secret Of Mana</span> be enough to banish the curse of boredom from our lives? And does that imply that games provide us with a distinct value? In a world where so many of us feel bored and alienated from our jobs, could games provide a special kind of amusement, one that instantly dissolves the memory of office-bound tedium? Are these fantasy projects really just as good as anything else—books, art, team sports, study, politics—that might fill out lives? Are the small victories in digital worlds really enough to keep the gray blankness of boredom at bay? “Leisure is in itself no more meaningful than work,” says Svendsen. “The basic question is how one chooses to be idle.” For those of us who choose video games, “idleness” can seem extremely satisfying, although we’re seldom idle in any obvious sense. Games are hives of activity. A few hours spent defeating puzzles in <span class="rend-i">Mario Sunshine</span> (often passing the controller back and forth between my partner and myself) seems just as fulfilling as most other leisure activities and happily balloons to fill almost any length of time you might imagine. Games are often dismissed as a timesink that makes us oblivious to the passing of the hours—but that’s part of the reason we play them, and it is, in my opinion, a very good thing.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that video games now comprise some of the most sophisticated and expensive technologies in the world. We have plowed countless millions of dollars into developing these electronic systems, and only a fraction of it is done for purely commercial reasons. The other motivation—amusement—is far more powerful. Gaming has claimed a huge stake in our culture, especially if you define culture as the time we spend on doing things that we don’t have to do. And it is not chance that our digital entertainments are so complex and demanding. Getting to the end of <span class="rend-i">Space Tripper</span> or completing <span class="rend-i">Resident Evil 4</span> are hardly trivial undertakings, and it says something about our desperation to sidestep boredom that so many tens of thousands of people have worked their way up to level 60 (or 70) in <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft.</span></p>
<p>Games represent a uniquely modern response to the proliferating phenomenon of boredom. Games are an electronic antidote to the chronic condition prophesied by Londoner and author J. G. Ballard: “I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that’s my one fear: that everything has happened; nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again… . the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul.” Ballard’s fiction is famous for exploring the idea that humans might end up resorting to psychopathic acts to escape this “suburb of the soul.” He sees the homogenous and commercialized future as a bleak one, filled with Svendsen’s boredom-through-meaninglessness. But my aim here is to show that we have rather less destructive solutions at hand for diverting such a bleak future—tools for play; engines for novelty and thrill, expression and exploration. Take time to examine a cross section of video games and you’ll encounter grand life simulations, blistering fictive racing experiments, ultradetailed management tools, savage retina-roasting fractal spectra, pet dogs, Escher physics, digital cooking competitions, boundless horror, and impossible geographies. Even if you don’t share the bleak outlook of soothsayers like Ballard, video games still represent a fascinating, ostentatious landscape of experiences that were not previously available to us. Perhaps we have boredom to thank for that.</p>
<p>The differences between genres of games are now so startling that commentators often struggle with the label of “game” when attempting to describe them. Contrast the players who puzzle through <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> to the <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> denizens who run businesses in virtual worlds. Contrast people jigging on dance mats to the long, slow precipitation of planning in a game of <span class="rend-i">SimCity.</span> Contrast my 40 minutes of absolute reptilian-response engagement in a game of <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> to a <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> player harvesting herbs to make a magic potion. The differences, the experiential wealth of gaming, makes it tough to describe and even harder to survey, but the games do all have one thing in common: for minutes, hours, weeks, months, and years of our lives, games defeat boredom.</p>
<p>In his 2006 essay “The Space to Play,” the Nokia futurologist Matt Jones considered the issues of play and gaming from the point of view of a designer and technological speculator. Jones wanted to show how designers could learn from activities like gaming to make their products more intuitive and more engaging. In so doing, he highlighted the psychological concept of “flow.” Jones explains: “Whether thrilling or relaxing, one thing that games designers can teach those wrestling with other more general forms of interaction design is a mastery of ‘flow.’ Identified by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow in human experience ‘is a mental state of operation in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing, characterized by a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and success in the process of the activity’ (to use the Wikipedia definition). Flow and play are inextricable—Csikszentmihalyi refers to the ‘playground’ environment necessary to attain a flow state, and the balance of challenge and ability that governs the flow state is essential to the sustenance of good play.”</p>
<p>The flow state is familiar to all gamers (the slang reference is something like “being in the zone”), and it was the main reason why I was obsessed with <span class="rend-i">Quake III.</span> Running the team and my subsequent lifestyle changes were means to the perfect moments of electronic combat, the feeling of control and precision, the awareness of flow. The same thing can, of course, be true of driving a car, having an excellent conversation, or being immersed in writing. But the extent to which our experience of games is an experience of psychological flow goes some way to explaining why we value it. And in my opinion, this experience is more than enough. Notwithstanding all the other ways games might change us, all the improvements to cognitive skills, social well-being, and welfare they can offer, the best—and ultimately only necessary—defense of games is that they keep us engaged and entertained. From extended engagement in hypnotic pattern completion to punctuated moments of joy in victory, we get something from gaming that feels important. As games proliferate and become still more sophisticated, we may well find that the Ballardian idea of the future as inevitably boring becomes unthinkable. Gamers, I think, are already there.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="2.2.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Splashdown</span></h4>
<p>It’s July 2007, and Southern England is being gradually submerged in the heaviest rains for 60 years. Intercity trains to and from the West Country, where I live, are forced to roll slowly through shallow lakes of water (a scene reminiscent of a drab, burned-out version of the end of the animated film <span class="rend-i">Spirited Away</span>). Half the London Underground is closed due to flooding, and I must take a circuitous, oversubscribed subway route to reach my destination, Victoria Station. The familiar central London travel hub is awash with water from the leaking roof. Hundreds of people stand about forlornly staring at the departure boards. Most trains out of the station have been canceled.</p>
<p>I’m going to be late for my meeting with an old <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> acquaintance, Paul “Locki” Wedgwood, who has long been a key member of the British and European <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> community. As a key organizational gamer, he was responsible for rallying my team to exhibition matches, and although we did not meet until many years later, we corresponded regularly around these events. Very occasionally, we even played in the same games.</p>
<p>“Locki” was a regular name on the <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> chat channels, and he managed to drum up plenty of support for the game and its variants on U.K. game services. The success of my team and dozens of others depended on people like Wedgwood running the community—delivering news, organizing competitions, and making sure servers stayed online. Their dedication meant the games were free and well maintained.</p>
<p>These days, however, Wedgwood’s interest in the <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> community is altogether more serious: he’s making the games that these online communities will play. Wedgwood is now the owner of Splash Damage, which is working with id Software and Activision to make <span class="rend-i">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.</span> (By the time you read this, <span class="rend-i">Quake Wars</span> will have been played by tens of thousands of gamers across the world. At the time I was traveling through London, however, almost no one had played the game, and it was a largely unknown quantity—just another work in progress.) This sequel to both <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> and <span class="rend-i">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</span>’s free <span class="rend-i">Enemy Territory</span> expansion will be one of the major games of 2007. It’s a first-person online shooter, like <span class="rend-i">Quake III,</span> in which gamers take up the roles of human defenders and alien invaders on a lavish futuristic battlefield. Given its pedigree, I’m boyishly excited about being able to play it for the first time. The flood-driven delays and the slowly trundling train I finally catch from Victoria combine in a nexus of frustration and make me want to scream. I regret not bringing a thicker book with me to read.</p>
<p>When I finally step into Splash Damage’s offices (over the pallet bridge across voluminous puddles), Wedgwood doesn’t seem to notice my tardiness. He’s all smiles. With glasses, goatee, black Splash Damage T-shirt, and a collection of sci-fi figurines around the windows of the demo room, he fulfills plenty of familiar gamer traits. But there’s something else detectable in him: a glint in the eye, a strong sense of just how focused and dedicated he has become. He’s a man who understands his mission. Video games have changed Wedgwood, and he knows it. More than that, he embraces it. Like so many other people I meet in London, Wedgwood is someone for whom games have become the currency of his life.</p>
<p>Wedgwood has been prodigiously successful, not only in creating a major game but in getting into a position of corporately funded creativity by virtue of his own passion for gaming. It’s fair to say that he’s one of London’s most accomplished gamers. <span class="rend-i">Quake Wars</span> may have been a massive project involving dozens of people and millions of dollars, but it was Wedgwood’s baby. He’s plugged into every aspect of it, and his face lights up with a mixture of pride, delight, and obsession as he demonstrates the game to me. He talks at speed, leaping from one subject to the next with alarming energy. He talks as one gamer does to another, with only the most minor inflections of marketingspeak creeping into his monologue. He stops and apologizes for talking in what he calls “salespeak,” explaining that he has trained himself to trot off accolades and financial factoids so that he can sell the game to distributors and retail reps. Getting the message across to the nongamers, especially these money men, has become a full-time job. I confirm that I understand, and we continue.</p>
<p>There must be hundreds of men like Wedgwood across Greater London—men for whom gaming has become the great escape. They’ve all come to games out of a desire for leisure-time distractions, but some, like Wedgwood and his colleagues, take it much further. In fact, on reflection, Wedgwood has probably taken his gaming further than any of the gamers I’ve met in the past decade. He has been utterly faithful to his obsession, and it has been faithful to him. He started off, like me, by finding a <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> team in the late 1990s—one of the European “clans” of <span class="rend-i">Team Fortress</span> and <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> players—and playing routinely. His competitive nature shone through as the team began to win on a routine basis. Wedgwood led from the front, as he has continued to do throughout his career in games. As he played more and more, he began to forge strong links with the people who made up the online community. More important, he had time to sink into writing news and running game Web sites. “I got a job as a contract IT guy in a bank in the City,” he explained in an interview we’d done a few months earlier. “Because it had trading floors, I wasn’t allowed to touch the network between nine and five. So my job was to sit at my desk and not touch anything. Instead of actually doing anything, I spent most of 1998 updating the <span class="rend-i">Team Fortress</span> news desk.” Suddenly he had a second job, and rather than dwelling on the lonely existence of a server administrator, he began to connect with a young, energetic community.</p>
<p>As Wedgwood became increasingly integrated in the gaming community, he began to get involved with the now-defunct gaming community service Barrysworld. At the same time, however, his work began to suffer. Like me, he’d found something more important. He soon lost his job at the bank and then another working for a government tech department. After months of chatting and gaming with the folks who ran the Barrysworld service, Wedgwood discovered that its chairman lived just a few blocks away in the same part of London. The two men arranged to meet for a drink, and soon Wedgwood was filling the role of infrastructure manager for the gaming service. “It was a big pay cut,” Wedgwood explained. “But by then I knew I had to be in the games industry.”</p>
<p>After a month of the familiar routine of commissioning servers and dealing with the technical issues of Internet gaming, Wedgwood found himself commentating on <span class="rend-i">Quake</span> matches that were to be televised on Now TV, a cable channel that was selling content into the Asian market. All the action took place during unsociable hours—weekends, evenings, and so on. “So during the week,” he explained, “I got more and more involved in mod work.” <span class="rend-i">Mod work,</span> or <span class="rend-i">modding,</span> is the process of taking an existing game and modifying it to create free variants. It’s a kind of nonprofit amateur game design. It was to be the foundation of what Wedgwood and his allies would do with the commercial <span class="rend-i">Quake Wars</span> project. “<span class="rend-i">Team Fortress</span> had been the main thing for us, but we were all looking forward to <span class="rend-i">Quake III.</span> I joined up with a mod team called <span class="rend-i">Q3F,</span> based on <span class="rend-i">Fortress,</span> and I soon became project leader for this <span class="rend-i">Quake III</span> mod.”</p>
<p>This was the crucial turning point for Wedgwood. By taking up modification, Wedgwood had set out not to make a game from scratch but, instead, to build something based on a work undertaken by a professional team. By standing on the shoulders of giants and repurposing what had gone before, Wedgwood could create something new and viable. In this case, it was a modification of <span class="rend-i">Quake III,</span> but Wedgwood could have chosen any number of commercial games. What was most significant about modding projects like this, however, was that it demonstrated that games were entering a new era and taking gamers with them. Wedgwood was working with a team that was based across Europe and getting help from game designers in Dallas in a project that would be the foundation for a new career in game development. His story was fascinating to me because it seemed to exemplify what so much coverage of the gaming press missed out on: how games were influencing the lives of the people who played them. It was becoming clear from my visits to London that they were influencing many, many people.</p>
<p>Wedgwood’s London was becoming another node in an international, globalized gaming culture. He and his team are representative of this latest phase of British gaming—one that is heavily influenced by American and Japanese game design but has also hooked itself up to an evolving, networked culture. The entire Splash Damage team were inspired by and connected via the Internet, and the game development—the modification—that they immersed themselves in was very different from the amateur games environment that had previously existed in the United Kingdom. Fifteen or twenty years earlier, homes across Britain were nurturing a generation of game designers whose experiences with games were rather unlike those of Wedgwood’s team. This was once a nation of “bedroom programmers,” a phenomenon of one- or two-man game design teams, facilitated by the simplicity of the 8-bit (and then 16-bit) home computers that proliferated at the end of the 1980s. The British games industry thrived in those years thanks to the sheer number of home computers and the creativity they engendered. While the rest of the world was falling into the thrall of Atari, Nintendo, and then Sega, Britain’s gaming language was being written in machine code on ZX Spectrums and Commodore Amigas. Game design was rampant, weird, and wonderful. The country produced both defining video games and a generation of gamers whose experience of making their own games was at odds with the way games are made today—in multimillion-dollar media studios across the world. Many Britons see that era of early home computing as a golden age of gaming. It was a time in which anyone could get involved in the process of making games. Copying a few lines out of a manual or learning a crude programming language was all it took to start making games. Almost everyone had access to the tools—home computing was cheap and ubiquitous; creativity was unbounded. Many of the principles of games as they are seen today were conceived and delivered in that neolithic era of computerized play.</p>
<p>The home-programming culture has now largely been lost, thanks to the increasing complexity and commercialization of gaming. There’s a pocket of personal creativity here and there (the British company Introversion springs to mind), but to create games now means raising large budgets and employing dozens of professionals, exactly as Wedgwood does in his South London studio. But Wedgwood’s project also demonstrates that there is still hope for individuals wanting to find their way in. Thanks to the tools and the technological scaffolding provided by modding, the bedroom programmers do still have a way of making something unique—even if it means working with others across the Net. In Wedgwood’s era, creativity is once again being facilitated by cheap computers and simple tools, but these are tools provided by the commercial games industry and distributed electronically.</p>
<p>Modifying games has become both the new amateur art form that could drive the creation of games onward and upward and the training grounds for potential commercial game creators. It’s not the only way of making amateur games—and the programming of one person can still achieve a great deal—but it is a new way, one that has had major ramifications for many of the gamers I have encountered. It makes the creation of games accessible to all—not just the gilded elite.</p>
<p>Where once Britain was a nation of solitary programmers, it is now a node in an international network of cut-and-paste video game creation—a place where gamers can get a leg up from the efforts of the professionals and create professional-looking games via a series of shortcuts. Modding games, I will later argue, is one of the ways in which gaming will begin to change gamers’ lives all over again. We’ll come back to Wedgwood and his companions later, as I discuss just how gamers have been inspired to change the medium in which they live and play.</p>

<a name="2.2.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Living Instances</span></h4>
<p>Let’s now leave me goggle-eyed in front of that first session of <span class="rend-i">Quake Wars</span> and roll back a few years to the time that followed my stint as a financial journalist (and consequently my most excruciating encounters with boredom). Back then I thought of London as a city of toil, depression, and long journeys spent jostling with exhausted commuters. I moved away to a cheerily provincial tourist trap of a town in the West Country of England, where I sit writing these words today. I was glad to see the back of the big city, and several times I turned down job offers that would have meant returning there. But soon my idea of London began to change. As my new career developed, I began to journey to London and greet the people I met there with a new perspective. The people I now traveled to London to see (people like Wedgwood) were illustrative of how and why my life had gone down the route it had. London became the place I went to in order to talk to interesting gamers—gamers who talk about <span class="rend-i">SingStar, Tekken,</span> or <span class="rend-i">Project: Ico</span> with wide eyes or razor-sharp sarcasm; gamers who are jet-lagged and still pumping with adrenaline from a weeklong gaming competition in Korea; gamers who are bitter about the loss of their “golden age” or thrilled by unforeseen developments. These knowledgeable, energetic people, who have things to say and insights to share, replaced the financiers and clerks of my previous life. These gamers were living instances of how games had changed people’s lives and how games had changed my life. Their enthusiasm was infectious, galvanizing.</p>
<p>My travels had begun to reveal that almost all writing and reporting concerned with gaming overlooked what the experience of gaming had meant to the gamers themselves. There was some talk about the intellectual or cognitive experience, but how games slotted into different lives and how they changed perceptions and agendas was being ignored. Most writing about games was about “the product” or about some particular phenomenon—virtual economies, violence in games, marriage via <span class="rend-i">EverQuest.</span> But there was more to it than that: I wanted to talk about what the gamers themselves were doing, to describe about what they were like and how the experience of gaming manifested itself in their different lives. How does that Saturday afternoon spent smashing cars in <span class="rend-i">Crackdown</span> fit into the life of a dedicated father and accountant? How are school-children’s personal politics influenced by educational games? How have South Korean youngsters turned avoiding boredom into a profession? The need to talk about these things was what made the present writing possible.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a man called Jonathan Smith. I encounter Smith on an irregular basis, each time bumping into him at a different stage in his career in games—here in an Internet café in central London, there at the Olympia convention center—each time with a different game-related theme. Smith had, I learned, once worked on the same magazine that had saved me from unemployment. Long before my time, he had moved on to write a book, to work on video games, to get a job with Lego, and eventually to found his own company. In 2006 I was sent on an assignment to see this new company and talk to its creative director.</p>
<p>I arrived at Smith’s far-periphery-of-London headquarters (on the outskirts of the conurbation somewhere near the Chilterns) on a mild summer afternoon. We had arranged the details of the meeting a couple of months previously in a hired barroom packed with bloggers and folk from the games industry—unshaven men who stood around drinking beer and trying not to talk about games—and so the venue for this latest meeting couldn’t have been more different. Set in a large, modestly maintained garden, the large Victorian house was unlike any other development office I had visited. It was a whole world of domesticity and languid porch-dwelling cats away from the sequence of downtown studios on office blocks I had reported on across the world. Smith’s office was situated in a small building on the grounds of the main house. He led the way down a gravel driveway of what was a very English home. It was the nerve center of development for the sequel to 2005’s most successful British video game, <span class="rend-i">Lego Star Wars,</span> which sold three and a half million copies its first year. “Of course, there are still offices where the work happens,” Smith explained as we entered the kitchen-office area to make a cup of tea and a sandwich. “Traveller’s Tales [the main studio] have about a hundred people in Manchester.” In that cottage just outside Burnham (a suburban appendix to the concrete jungles of Slough), Smith and the company director, Tom Stone, along with their lead producers and the Q &amp; A team (secreted upstairs in the cottage bedrooms), were working toward making the perfect sequel to the previous year’s success.</p>
<p>Smith sat down in a large, well-upholstered armchair to tell me about the relationship he had created between several different game companies. His own small production unit had to work with the larger development studio (Traveller’s Tales) as well as Lego, the publishers at Activision, and the <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> franchise controllers at LucasArts. “It’s a relationship of love,” Smith laughed. “Everyone has input onto what the game should be, so it’s never a forced marriage.” Smith is one of a small cadre of gamer-developers who seem to have exact control over their passion for gaming. The results of this focused energy have meant that the people who work around Smith display enormous trust in his abilities to create a worthwhile game. One of his team confided in me that he was amazed by Smith’s insight and long-term enthusiasm for the medium. They were traits I had seen many times in people who were gamers long before they were industry professionals.</p>
<p>The fact that both Activision and LucasArts (two games industry monoliths) were now so interested in the <span class="rend-i">Lego Star Wars</span> concept seemed like a reflection of Smith’s honed gaming instincts. People had been uncertain about the idea of fusing <span class="rend-i">Star Wars</span> with Lego, but that kind of doubt hadn’t been an issue for Smith. His time working at Lego had been revelatory, and he articulated some of that effect on him. He talked about being “immersed in toys” and explained that the attitude Lego had toward their “play materials” (the plastic kits) had gone a long way toward expanding his own understanding of what it is to play. For someone who had been around gaming for decades, it seemed like a period of refreshment and enlightenment. “Play has many meanings and its own semantics. Lego was about nothing less than fun,” said Smith. “And that’s not mere corporate gobbledygook. To be immersed in that and tasked with finding out what games Lego could make was liberating. We meshed that with our own commercial awareness, so it wasn’t just R &amp; D. It was about making something that kids would love to play with.” But, more important, Smith was, for the first time, really set on making something that everyone could enjoy.</p>
<p>“We knew we had what it took to express Lego interactively,” said Smith, although the expression of plastic toy in sci-fi video game was clearly never a straightforward problem. “There was a big challenge in making the minifigure into a video game character. Animating them makes a video game character, but it has to be done in a way that makes them a video game and not a simulation.” Watching Smith steer Princess Leia’s chunky legs around the screen suggested that there was as much inspiration as perspiration in making that happen. This idea of his game not being a simulation was important to Smith. <span class="rend-i">Lego Star Wars</span> was about playing, not about building. It was not an attempt to simulate Lego itself. “It’s not a ‘CAD’ experience,” said Smith, when I ask him why there’s no “real” building in <span class="rend-i">Lego Star Wars</span> but, rather, a series of puzzles in which pieces assemble themselves. “It’s not a simulation of the plastic Lego experience—it’s the imaginative exercise. It’s exploration. Lego translates differently into the video game space. It’s not about building, because that becomes frustrating. Of course, you can mix things up in the game world, but not in the same way as the real world.”</p>
<p>This was where Smith’s philosophy as a gamer became apparent: “We are delivering imagination and not simulation.” You can see these aspects of Smith’s attitude emerging within the game: there’s a constant two-player dynamic, where someone can drop in and join the first player at any moment—someone like a busy parent. Smith says, quite seriously, that he thinks the Lego games are “for the child in all of us.” It’s clear that his project is motivated not by a desire to make video games for money but by a motivation to make video games for his own family. Smith is the father of three, and the experience of parenthood seems to have defined and completed his understanding of games. “We focus on the reactions of children,” he says. “Specifically my two boys.” For Smith, making video games for a younger audience is clearly a personal matter. The ultimate judge and jury of his life’s work will be his own children, and that means that games development is more than just a job.</p>
<p>Smith’s joy was evident as he sat next to me, showing me what he had made. It was gaming that had allowed him to create something unique and given him a mission. And his purpose wasn’t some mysterious tier of administration or paperwork that would be alien and abstract from the lives of his children; instead, it was right here in front of us. We picked it up and we played.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="2.2.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Label</span></h4>
<p>The journalist Will Self once remarked that he would probably identify himself as a Londoner before identifying himself as a man, so important was the effect of the city on his psyche. In a similar way, I would probably identify myself as a gamer more than a writer, a human being, or a European citizen. The same is true for many other gamers: their job and ethnicity are subordinate to the fact of how their leisure time is spent. The classification “gamer” has become a badge of honor and, occasionally, a badge of shame. The label has (at least in the West) taken on a peculiar potency that doesn’t quite seem parallel with “cinemaphile” or “art lover.” Perhaps it’s because gamers have been to some degree vilified and mocked that they have felt a need to grasp onto and highlight their identity. They have appropriated the term for their own uses.</p>
<p>The blogger Alice Taylor has mused on this subject a number of times in her endless trawl through the most obscure corners of gaming culture. “If everyone’s a gamer, or even a majority, then ‘gamer’ will lose its tribal status,” she told me. “It’s currently a subculture, an identity statement. It will just become another ordinary ‘doing’ label: viewer, watcher, listener, gamer.” Taylor’s blog is largely motivated by her love of picking up on the gamer label: she blogs fashion and furniture, phones and furry toys, each item emblazoned with or inspired by the iconography and language of gaming. Gamers like Taylor are endlessly absorbed in the active process of bonding themselves with these symbols, the icons of their enjoyment. The tattoos stained into the skin of a number of my friends testify to the visceral reality of their commitment to these gaming identities.</p>
<p>Of course, the gamer label only identifies an indefinite aspect of a person. We don’t all play the same games or even place the same value in games. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a difference between those people for whom games are little more than a distraction and those for whom games are of defining importance. Gamers have been changed in some of the ways I have already listed here but also in many other ways besides. It’s possible that the gamer label to some degree matches up with the industry’s internal identification of “hard-core” and “casual” gamers. This distinction has proven to be something of a myth but has nevertheless been used by developers and publishers to distinguish between the kinds of people who will simply dabble in the odd game of <span class="rend-i">Solitaire</span> or freeware <span class="rend-i">Mah-jongg</span> and those who commit vast amounts of time and money to habitual gaming. The latter people, to my mind, are the true gamers.</p>
<p>The habitual, hard-core gamers are people who have discovered something essential in gaming. What these people get from video games cannot be found elsewhere, and it is difficult to determine precisely what that thing is (although I suspect it has something to do with their personal projects of staying entertained). The range of possible gaming experiences is so vast that any survey will rapidly be overwhelmed or lose its way: gaming is no longer readily described or bracketed. The local status of a Japanese arcade hero hammering his way through epically difficult fighting games on a single credit seems worlds apart from the solitary hours I spent locked into the epic ultradetailed private fantasy world of the <span class="rend-i">Elder Scrolls</span> game <span class="rend-i">Oblivion.</span> What my retro-loving friend gets from the ancient classics of <span class="rend-i">Yar’s Revenge</span> and <span class="rend-i">Breakout</span> seems to have little connection with the drunken evenings of <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero</span> we enjoy elsewhere. The experiences that video games provide, the services they offer, cover a vast spectrum of possibility. We use <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> on our mobile phone to make a train journey pass quickly, we turn a <span class="rend-i">Final Fantasy</span> game into “duvet terrain” when we’re feeling tired and emotional. For hard-core gamers, video games have done more than distract or entertain us. They’re vital experiences in which we’ve uncovered something useful, something vital in our lives<span class="rend-i">.</span></p>
<p>One of these hard-core gamers, an adopted Londoner, is Leo Tan. He is a man whom I first met with his face illuminated by the screen of a handheld Nintendo. Does he think of himself primarily as a gamer? “Yes, completely,” he says, “but I wouldn’t say it has ever been a revelation at any point; I didn’t wake up one day and think, ‘Holy shit, I’m a gamer!’ I suppose I’m just as likely to identify myself as Scottish, if it makes someone more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Given Tan’s personal history, it seems strange that he should worry about whether the gamer label would make people feel uncomfortable. He’s right, though: the unfamiliar often does make people nervous. Tan knows all about that. He grew up on the Pennyburn, a council estate on the outskirts of Kilwinning, a small town in the west of Scotland. It was a place where “the schools have bars on the windows and huge fences to keep the children in, and all the mental kids carry Stanley blades.”</p>
<p>Tan’s memories of that time are grim. “Growing up there was not much fun for me, who felt like the only Chinese kid within a thousand miles. Loads of fighting and being beaten up by huge Scots, a general fear of being out on the streets.” For him, as for thousands of other children, games allowed a route for escape, a tunnel out of a place where there was no option to belong. It was the perfect alternative to ugly reality and to looming boredom: “Gaming was my escape when going out on the streets was no longer valid. Life at home was hell thanks to an alcoholic mum and an abusive step dad. My life consisted of getting out of the house whenever they were at home or staying in my room playing games whenever they were out at the pub. Much of my time out of the house was spent at a friend’s playing games. Whenever I look back on my childhood, I can mostly remember just the games. Nostalgia for some people is remembering fields and playing soldiers in the trees; for me, it’s <span class="rend-i">Roland on the Ropes</span> on the Amstrad CPC 464 and <span class="rend-i">Captive</span> on the Atari ST. Those worlds and my time in them provide the basis for all of my reminiscing.” Tan is not alone in these memories.</p>
<p>When he grew up, Tan did something that probably doesn’t come naturally to all kids who have spent most of their youth savoring computer games: he became a hairdresser. But even with this new career of haircuts and expensive shampoo, the computerized pastimes were not forgotten; Tan still bought and played everything he could. More important, though, he continued to find friends who had the same interests, people with the same ideas about games. He found much of this companionship on Internet game forums, such as the one hosted by the infamous British video game magazine <span class="rend-i">Edge:</span> “I was on it at least a few hours a day, which seems like a tremendous waste of time in hindsight. Or at least it would if it hadn’t have got me my job. On the forum, I met [London-based public relations executive] Simon Byron, my current boss. I was getting bored with hairdressing, so after ten years of talking to hot girls about their sex lives, I asked Simon Byron for a job. Literally, I said, ‘Can I have a job?’ and he said, ‘Yes.’ That was it, really. I didn’t really have a job interview or anything. I joined the games industry solely on my forum posting. Simon thought I could write and that I knew about games, and that was enough.”</p>
<p>Echoing the sentiments I’ve heard from dozens of other gamers over the years, Tan recalled how he suddenly felt at home in a job where he got to talk about and work on the things he loved: “I’ve spent a lifetime feeling separated from everything and everyone around me. Things that I’ve cared about have not, by and large, been the things that other people around me care about. I have made some incredible friends growing up who also love games, but by and large we were not part of the ‘community,’ for lack of a better term.” The video games that gave the young Tan something to escape into had ended up giving a focus to his adult life, just as it had done for me, Smith, Wedgwood, and countless other Londoners. Tan, however, had gone one better than any of us.</p>
<p>When working on the marketing for the rhythm-action masterpiece <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero,</span> Tan and his colleagues arranged a publicity stunt at Donnington rock festival, the United Kingdom’s largest heavy metal event: they would play <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero</span> on stage in the opening hours of the concert. In a life that had been framed by gaming, this seemed like the ultimate achievement, a ludicrous, triumphant epiphany of video gaming.</p>
<p>Tan swells with pride at the mere mention of the event: “We opened for Guns ’N’ Roses,” he boasts. “Technically speaking, we opened for everyone. Gibson gave us their stage, so we just plugged in and went for it. We were really scared. We had no idea what the crowd would do when they saw our plastic guitars. We thought the worst that can happen would be bottles of piss thrown at us or maybe the crowd rushing the stage and smashing our faces in, so when we opened, my hands were shaking and I missed easy notes. Our tent quickly filled, as we were the only music anywhere, and they loved it. I think most of the crowd knew the game. They were cheering for songs during the options screen, and we had kids up on stage playing. Most of them were nailing the final tier songs on <span class="rend-i">Expert;</span> some played behind their head. It was incredible. It was the exact opposite of our worst fears. And playing <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero</span> on stage is a completely different experience to playing at home. At home, you might feel like a guitar god; but on stage, people are screaming, and when you come off, they swamp to the sides to try to talk to you. It’s exhilarating in a way that I’ll never experience elsewhere. And it was a game. <span class="rend-i">And everyone knew it was a game.</span>” Somehow, impossibly, Tan had been there when gaming turned into rock and roll. How’s that for entertainment?</p>
