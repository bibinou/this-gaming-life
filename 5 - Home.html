<a name="5.1.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Just Dirt</span></h4>
<p>I’ve just been to California and back in around 80 hours. It was a typical games press jaunt: a few hours in an air-conditioned room, somewhere in a business district on the outskirts of a major city, a few minutes of private pixelated chaos, and hours of numbing travel.</p>
<p>The night I set out, Heathrow was in quiet chaos. Although the bus lane was closed, there was no sign that anything might be wrong, and only a well-informed Cockney electrician (“Oi mate, you speaka da English?”) seemed to know that the buses to nearby hotels were not running. In fact, it turned out that nobody really knew what was going on, because it was too late in the evening for information. Help desks in this 24-hour airport close at 9 p.m. So I took my cues from overhearing from a lost-looking girl who was asking people where the taxi stand was. We meandered up through the multistory parking garage to the signage-free taxi area, where at least a hundred people were waiting for cabs in the rain.</p>
<p>You see, you can’t walk and expect to get outside of Heathrow. The road tunnel and runway mean that the Heathrow terminal complex is entirely cut off from perambulation. The choices are train, plane, wheels, or isolation on the terminal floor, and so I had to spend 10 pounds sterling to travel less than a third of a mile in a shared cab with the wandering girl.</p>
<p>I spent the night at the Park Inn hotel, which was a cross between a disco and a prison. The corporate theme was defined by rude blocks of primary color, and the elevators were filled with a gloriously kitschy rotating spectrum of light—red through blue and green, via yellow and purple—as if we were ascending to some dream of 1970s decadence. The rooms, meanwhile, were cells: bed, TV, and single steel cup and saucer, for making the tea or instant coffee. There was a deep hum from within the hotel’s concrete innards.</p>
<p>I had an early flight. The sour-looking fat man on the passport control desk told me that I wouldn’t be granted access to the United States with less than six months left on my passport. “You might want to think about that on your flight,” he said, like a teacher reprimanding a naughty child. He was also unable to tell me anything more and so simply instructed me to move along. I might have been heading off to international detention, but he didn’t care and seemed perfectly happy to let me into the terminal anyway.</p>
<p>I tried to find out more about my predicament at the information desk, which was manned by a blank-faced Scottish woman with dyed red hair. “Who brought you in?” the woman repeatedly asked, but the question made no sense. Eventually I seemed to manage to get her to understand my predicament, and she phoned someone. She shrugged, saying, “You should be fine.” Then she looked suspicious and added, “Unless you know some other reason why you should not be allowed to travel?”</p>
<p>Worried and exasperated, I phoned everyone I know. They were, with two exceptions, asleep. No one seemed to know whether the sourpuss at the passport desk was right that I should expect to be detained or deported. I’d just have to fly to Los Angeles and find out. I boarded the plane with a sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>I woke up somewhere over the Rockies. The scene was spectacular: the bright blue strip of the upper Colorado River (swollen by the Hoover Dam and dotted with pleasure boats full of tourists absorbing the astonishing geography) scythed through jagged red mesas. This gave way to weird foamlike stone formations and then, beyond that, the vast earth-splitting chasms of the Grand Canyon and the mountainous monoliths of the Southwest. From 30,000 feet, it was like a divine lesson in topological extremity. With exquisite skies and an even more wonderful vista below, I was entranced.</p>
<p>Behind me sat an aging Californian couple, evidently not superwealthy (we were in coach class) but certainly rich in aspiration. They wore tailored shirts, Rolex watches, Chanel sunglasses. They talked quietly, and I heard the man say, “Let’s see what’s out there.” He opened his porthole shutter. They looked out of the window at the jagged wilderness for a moment, and then the woman responded, “Mmm, just dirt.” Her husband seemed to concur, and he closed the shutter tight.</p>
<p>We came in low over Los Angeles. <span class="rend-i">SimCity</span>-like zone planning was evident. Strip malls seemed to have been placed with a flick of the mouse.</p>
<p>U.S. passport control let me in without incident. Mentally I castigated Heathrow’s sour-faced passport controller. I promised myself that I’d write a letter of complaint about how I’d been handled, but I never did.</p>
<p>Thanks to my frantic phone calls earlier in the day, I was met by one of the people involved in organizing the trip. Being a lovely man, he gave me a ride to the hotel. We talked about video games. He had been a journalist before he’d decided he actually wanted to own his own house. LA sprawled endlessly in every direction. We drove past a Goodyear blimp, tethered on a disused soccer field. Roadside billboards promised “Robotic Massage” and “Grand Rug Liquidation.” Later, we zoomed past the LA Galaxy stadium, where a fading David Beckham would wow the few sports fans who didn’t spend their money on baseball or American football.</p>
<p>The video game matters that had brought me to California passed in a pleasing haze of jet lag, real-time strategy, excellent catering, and late-night typing. The modern business of games marketing is one of peculiar secrecy and lighthearted banter. My hosts were evidently terrified that I might discover something about secret projects, as yet unannounced. Following the prison theme, I had to be accompanied to the office toilet between gameplay sessions. Hushed tones in the local Starbucks conveyed a message: don’t give anything away to the journalists. And, this time at least, they do not give anything away, other than the approved marketing message. The game is new, improved, and <span class="rend-i">Next Generation.</span> We don’t bother to write this down in our spiral-bound notepads.</p>
<p>At dawn, I wandered around the local commercial estates—offices, hotels, blank nonresidential buildings made from glass or prefabricated concrete. There was a pleasant mist from the sprinklers that are embedded in the perfectly manicured lawns. These planes and vectors of tightly packed grass were so perfect, in fact, that they could have been rolled up and stowed away each night like a (liquidated) rug. The total anonymity of the buildings, bearing such labels as “Anetech Corp” and “Integrated Services Inc.” made the entire place seem like a facade—a video game backdrop. There were no pedestrians, just a few passing cars that stopped occasionally on the six-lane provincial boulevard. (Things aren’t really bigger in the United States; they’re just wider.) Patrolling these spaces while listening to Brian Eno’s finest ambient work, <span class="rend-i">The Shutov Assembly,</span> on my cheap, verging-on-disposable MP3 player turned my early morning walk into a surrealist montage of long streets, palm trees, empty parking lots, and gong noises.</p>
<p>In the evening, I ate with the marketing man and a small posse of video game journalists. We were unshaven, pale, European, and out of sync with Southern California. The French editor’s voice rasped like a latter-day Tom Waits record, his Parisian accent almost absurd in its weight. We exchanged anecdotes: drunken escapades on the Unreal 2 press trip, reasons to love or loathe the next batch of games on the horizon, tales of booze and electronic toys. The slow, quiet laughter and rotating storytelling seemed to suggest that we were all doing what we wanted to be doing and yet that we were all dissatisfied. Games journalists never seem to run out of things to talk about or complain about.</p>
<p>Slowed by jet lag and Guinness, we passed the Taco Bell building. A giant black-glass edifice in the daytime, it’s an inwardly lit tower at night, betraying the late-night taco executives working hard on their charges (“We’re going to design the best goddamn taco ever! We’ll stay here all night if we have to!”). And so my work was complete. I traveled back to the United Kingdom relieved, exhausted. As we flew back across America, I stared out at the twilit dirt of the Rockies and thought about how many games are about terrain. I was drifting sleepward somewhere near the Great Salt Lake of Utah. I couldn’t tell where the mountains ended and the sky began.</p>

<a name="5.1.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Magical Calligraphy</span></h4>
<p>On returning home to Bath Spa, the partially mummified nineteenth-century town where I live in the West Country of England, I felt a sense of relief. As the train pulled into the station, I was glad to be back in familiar territory. I’m always eager to slump into familiar routines—home turf is where the slacker can take over. I forget about foreign cities and try to remember to buy groceries and cat food. I want to concentrate on the here and the now. Or I think I do.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, I’m rocketing through an Arabian temple racetrack in a fresh level of <span class="rend-i">Sonic and the Secret Rings.</span> Later I’ll explore <span class="rend-i">Okami,</span> the water-colored adventures of a Japanese god-wolf and her magical calligraphy. Or perhaps I’ll simply sit and play <span class="rend-i">Wipeout</span> until I’m flying down textured corridors in my sleep. I take notes: ideas for new descriptions of games and for better jokes and puns than the ones I exhausted last month. Even now, with journeys complete, I am heading off into other places.</p>
<p>What strikes me now, as I sit down to compose the final words of this writing, is my own ambivalence toward games and toward the culture in which I travel. I am caught between my personal interest in the games and the gamers who play them, on the one hand, and the billion-dollar business machine for which I have become a regular mouthpiece, on the other. I am troubled by the idea that games have to have some greater purpose than entertainment, and yet I am enthralled by the idea that they can be used as propaganda, art, or medicine. I want to spend all my time exploring the peculiar physics of a new game world, and yet I am compelled to write about and describe it for money.</p>
<p>The people who read early drafts of this manuscript detected these ambivalences, too: they thought I was confused or somewhat evasive. On the one hand, I clearly wanted to point out that people are doing more with the medium than merely entertaining each other, but on the other hand, I wanted to proclaim that the dissolution of boredom (that ennui lite that defines the early twenty-first century) is the most important achievement of gaming. Which was it going to be?</p>
<p>Gaming changed my life: but then don’t all vocations change us? Games are a great deal of fun, but is that three-letter word really enough to encompass it all? I don’t think it is. There’s something else happening here, something that surfaces intermittently throughout this writing. For some people, gaming might have been a passing phase, but for the people in these pages, it’s more like a life’s calling: a sudden point of access to their own future. Some of us know that for however long we’re going to be treading the boards of this earth, we’re also going to be obsessively examining, creating, and manipulating electronic games. It’s our contribution to the magnificent mess of human culture.</p>
<p>Not that we’ll think of it like that. We’ll be too busy micromanaging lunar bases or fighting exploding bears. As I write these words, my cargo-hauling spacecraft is undocking from a long-term base in <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span>—a place as familiar to me as the street outside or the downstairs kitchen reeking of burned sausage. I’ll leave the ship to make its journey unattended while I visit some friends in <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> (on my “spare” PC) and make my excuses for not joining them on a trawl through the Sunken Temple. I’m just popping my head in there to check my virtual mail and to see if the auction on that magic hammer is going my way. <span class="rend-i">Warcraft,</span> like most other online worlds, requires you to do some housekeeping if you intend to keep on top of things—doing your shopping at the auction house is just one such task. I have errands to run today, both real and imaginary.</p>
<p>And so, in much the same way that writers used to spend wistful hours staring out a window as they failed to compose their novels, I stare out through my screen. I can supplement old-fashioned daydreaming with an endless parade of possible worlds. Games, it seems, have no end and no distinct purpose. We have the screen to thank for this lack of precision. The proliferation of computerized screens is one of the biggest changes our world has ever seen—easily as big as the spread of the printed word or the domestication of broadcast radio. It is a conceptual shift of the kind that tends to happen without our really noticing. Television, cinema, the car, cell phones—they all changed the way we think about the world, but the revolution was slow and subtle. Now, without our consent, we find that our imaginations are at least partly defined by cinematographers and game designers—people didn’t have filmic dreams before TV and cinema; they didn’t have driving dreams before the car; and they certainly didn’t dream of turn-based space station management from an isometric perspective, as I do on occasion. Now phones, cars, and games are ubiquitous, and screens are too. They impinge on everything from the way we sleep to the metaphors we use. Gamers dream and think gaming, bookmarks, world browsers, pause buttons, save points, and extra lives. (And that’s as much a result of the Internet as of gaming—I regularly pick up books and wish I were able to hit CTRL-F to instantly summon a specific phrase, while a friend of mine regularly expresses his desire to be able to “bookmark” objects around the house, just as he can bookmark pages around the Internet. That way, he suggests, he’d avoid the daily loss of his keys.) Don’t we all wish we had a “save point” before that vital conversation or that critical interview. Or maybe we just need the cheat codes.</p>
<p>This generation can barely imagine what that primitive era before the screen must have been like. We depend on our windows to everywhere—television, video games, the Internet, even TV phones. Your window looks on the world with an electronic eye, and you’re selectively telepathic via instant messaging and cell phones. No matter where Mom is, you can phone her up and share the news. Perhaps you can even send pictures: “Look Mom, no hands! It’s Bluetooth!”</p>
<p>Without the screen and all the things that plug into it, I would not be anything like the person I am today. That person isn’t always a fun-loving one, either. I am prone to grumble. I grumble about games and about gamers. On blogs, in magazine or newspaper articles, during barroom talk—wherever it may be, I find reasons to criticize gaming and to criticize other gamers. This grumbling is partly due to the fact that the majority of commercial games are awful, money-grabbing garbage that instill cynicism in anyone who is exposed to them for more than a few seconds, but there’s a deeper reason, too: simply put, so few games are what I need them to be. Those few games, the finest fragments of the medium, are able to do what I require of them. They push the right psychological buttons and offer a satisfactory mode of escape. But most games are nothing more than a waste of time. In fact, there are so many games now that it’s tough to find what we need, even if we’re actively searching. There are a few accepted classics, but then there’s still the problem of format and accessibility: where do you get these games, and will they work on your games machine? You can’t just wander down to the library and pick up an armful of the most important games; there isn’t an edition of the collected works of Shigeru Miyamoto on the bookshelf of every home. Unlike other media, there’s no single route into gaming. It’s a jungle, a quagmire, a mess. Over the years, many gamers have said similar things to me: games aren’t quite there. There are too many inconsistencies, too many faults and problems and near misses of quality and quantity. What frustrates the grumblers is our shared suspicion that one day, with a bit of luck, games could be what we can imagine they should be. And I’m sorry retro gamers, but I think the golden age of gaming is yet to come. I have only limited nostalgia for our past.</p>
<p>In the last four gaming decades, there have been constant signposts, benchmarks of progress. Gamers are pushing this thing forward because, in some way, the nature of games has always inclined that way, toward the future. I’ve tried to contribute as a critic and commentator, championing lost or missed games or talking about what seems to have gone right with certain titles. Others, too, are working toward their own ideal: gamers build, mod, develop, play, eulogize, damage, hack, and blog games into new places, and they do it because they want difference and they want more. I think these people are dissatisfied because they are the pioneers in a gold rush: they’ve glimpsed the possibilities, and now they know that the riches await us, out there, somewhere over the horizon. The terrain has not been developed or refined, and there are no maps. It’s proving to be a difficult journey. Perhaps this is where the ambivalence is coming from: the recognition that games mean change.</p>

<a name="5.1.3"></a><h4>
<span class="rend-i">Installed</span> Doom</h4>
<p>Marshal McLuhan, the “patron saint” of <span class="rend-i">Wired</span> magazine and an influential media critic, suggested that each new cultural medium changes “the ratio of the senses,” or the overall balance between vision and sound, images and music. Words, which had been so important since the Gutenberg press, lost ground to cinema and television at the start of the twenty-first century, and the ratio of the senses shifted to the moving image and to the visual. As cinema came into the ascendant, its visual motifs began to dominate our imaginations and our culture. The importance of words as a medium decreased, and the importance of image, especially moving image, became central to our understanding of our world. McLuhan’s ratio cannot remain static and will constantly vary over time, swinging back and forth as our media shifts and changes in its influence on us. Games represent the biggest potential change in that ratio since Gutenberg. Perhaps, even more important, our sensory ratio will now be in constant and dissatisfying flux, in keeping with the fact that games contain and exhibit all previous media, from literature to pop music, from animation to cinema. Games will not stop to find a balance between all these ingredients: change (and licensing for bad movie tie-ins) is the only constant.</p>
<p>I hope that gamers reach magnificent, unforeseen heights of achievement in my lifetime. I would hate to have been born a thousand years too early and miss the big bang or the wondrous future zenith of gaming. Thanks to the ambitious, visionary ideas of academics like Luis von Ahn and Nina Fefferman, I do harbor some pretty far-fetched, utopian ideas about the future of gaming. It’s a future in which gamers are making games into better games simply by playing and in which games make the world a better place simply by virtue of being played. I’ve presented some reasons for this optimistic vision, but it nevertheless remains mostly in the realm of futurology—little better than science fiction. But perhaps that’s okay. After all, sci-fi writers have managed to predict a great many of the things that have come to pass in recent years. Numerous commentators have been at pains to point out that <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> was loosely defined by the concept of “the Metaverse,” as conjured by Neal Stephenson’s superb sci-fi novel <span class="rend-i">Snow Crash.</span> Stephenson defined a virtual 3-D system in which people interacted socially and economically and whose reality was only loosely based on the physics of the everyday world, rather like <span class="rend-i">Second Life:</span> “Like any place in Reality, the Street is subject to development. Developers can build their own small streets feeding off the main one. They can build buildings, parks, signs, as well as things that do not exist in Reality, such as vast hovering overhead light shows, special neighborhoods where the rules of three-dimensional spacetime are ignored, and free-combat zones where people can go hunt and kill each other… . it’s just a computer graphics protocol written down on a piece of paper somewhere—none of these things is physically being built.”</p>
<p>Retrospectively, this literary invention doesn’t seem like too much of a stretch, especially given how recently Stephenson’s book was written (1992), but it’s no less indicative of the state of sci-fi commentary. Writers have long seen the information technologies of the future from a distance, and it has always excited them. Last year, I read a rambling collection of essays, <span class="rend-i">The Shape of Further Things,</span> in which sci-fi author Brian Aldiss proposed the ubiquity of mobile phones and the enormity of the Internet (or “the Big Hookup” as he called it) as he sat in his English country house in the winter of 1969. His vision thrilled me: which of today’s authors are mapping the shape of things to come in the later twenty-first century? (I particularly enjoyed Aldiss’s classification of science fiction as “the sub-literature of change,” a label that actually only seems relevant to a very small slice of science fiction, both then and now.) Writers like Aldiss produce a great deal of material, and only fragments of it can be seen as genuinely prescient. Science fiction might have brought us cyberpunks in virtual arenas and minds sold into lifelong gaming, but these visions are still disconnected from the reality: the cheery baangs of South Korea or the heap of commercial gaming machines that lies downstairs beneath my aging TV. Science fiction glanced many of the details, but the big picture, the wide-screen fuzziness of reality, had to be written, day by day, by real people. I don’t think anyone knew gaming would turn out to be quite the way it is now.</p>
<p>Futurologists and sci-fi writers have routinely sketched technologically advanced cultures in which leisure time (and perhaps more important, spending on leisure) is dramatically increased. They have often suspected that robots or computers would take over the mass of work and leave us idle. Did these visions, in fact, predict the leisure society of today and the problems of boredom and idleness that accompany it? Sci-fi futures often pose the problem of what to do in worlds where work has been abolished by machinery, and sci-fi characters usually go mad or end up destroying themselves in order to illustrate some allegorical point about the value of work. But perhaps the reality of it is that we just end up playing video games in the long boring gaps between our holidays on Mars. Perhaps video games have arisen because the futurologists were right and we really do risk getting bored as we’re faced with ever-larger swathes of leisure time.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this, a link arrives via a flashing instant message box—it’s a story that someone thought I might be interested in. The link takes me to a Web version of an article in <span class="rend-i">Time</span> magazine, first published in 1966. The article predicts the future of work in America, via an interview with the Rand Corporation analyst Herman Kahn. It reads: “By 2000, the machines will be producing so much that everyone in the U.S. will, in effect, be independently wealthy… . With Government benefits, even nonworking families will have, by one estimate, an annual income of $30,000–$40,000 [$250,000 in today’s money]. How to use leisure meaningfully will be a major problem, and Herman Kahn foresees a pleasure-oriented society full of ‘wholesome degeneracy.’”</p>
<p>Wholesome degeneracy. There’s another borrowed description of gaming for the list. And while we’re not yet managing to live on spontaneously generated fortunes, who could deny the reality of the “pleasure-oriented society” of the early twenty-first century? The reality of poverty in all advanced nations is far from what the optimistic Herman Kahn foresaw, but he seems, nevertheless, to have been onto something. He anticipated that we would spend fortunes on creating leisure technologies for ourselves. He suspected that vast amounts of leisure time could never be unproblematic, but perhaps the real issue wasn’t how idle we’d be but how far we would go in the pursuit of entertainment. No other medium is as voracious as gaming: it consumes music, comics, fiction, television, sculpture, animation, architecture, history—all in the name of entertainment.</p>
<p>A journalist friend of mine named Tim Edwards once sat in a bar and argued, to anyone who would listen, that games were a kind of ultimate decadence. They are as expensive to create as anything else on earth and utterly rooted in the pursuit of pleasure. These are sophisticated, arousing experiences that have few of the ugly side effects of drugs or debauchery. They are the indulgence of animal impulses without actual violence or brazen depravity. Games, said Edwards, were a trip to the gladiatorial arena without any blood spilled. This was war in exotic lands without the danger of maiming or malaria. This was a packaged, streamlined, compartmentalized orgy of the senses.</p>
<p>I think Edwards might be onto something, but orgiastic or otherwise, it would be ridiculous to claim that games bring only good news. Many of them, unable even to manage the bright lights and snazzy spectacle we’ve come to expect, only bore us. Some of us are finding games dangerously compulsive and play them to the exclusion of other, more important things in our lives. Some of us are just wasting time and money on games and game toys that were never any good in the first place. Games are not a blight on society, but they aren’t a panacea either. Perhaps games, like most other human inventions, are tools—tools that we are very slowly learning to use for all kinds of new purposes. Acknowledging all those different purposes is going to be crucial to defining what it is to be a gamer.</p>
<p>That process is only just beginning. As of 2007, almost all of the people who have significantly influenced the medium of video games are still living and working: we’re right at the beginning of this thing. The most recent entrants, the founding fathers, the whole human history of electronic games is alive now. And it refuses to falter: these fertile technologies just keep on spreading, and people keep on pushing them in new directions. In writing about games over the past 10 years, I’ve traveled across most of the developed world, and I don’t expect my journeys in gaming to end there. My personal science fiction of gaming, the future I would like to see emerge, is not confined to the offices and TV parlors of the Western world but, instead, spreads everywhere and to everyone. If texts like this one contain a little bit of science-fiction, then it’s because we want certain futures to come to pass. Just as Aldiss predicted something positive like the Internet, so I hope to predict something positive about the global gaming society to come. Perhaps, if we push hard enough, some of those predictions might prove to be more than mere fictions.</p>
<p>Consider this: the One Laptop per Child trade association, spawned by MIT visionaries, wants to make 100 million cheap, robust laptops and deliver them into the developing world. The overall goal is education and the alleviation of poverty, but this project also places gaming technologies in the hands of people for whom games are currently an unknown, alien quantity. A new generation, a new culture, as yet untouched by the hungry medium of gaming, will get its first taste of our electronic frontier.</p>
<p>The foundation might have designed the Children’s Machine, or $100 Laptop, with the intention of aiding third world children and easing the technology gap in developing countries, but that won’t be its only consequence. These techno-philanthropists who are conspiring to create a climate of ubiquitous, accessible, global computing could inadvertently usher in a climate of global, ubiquitous, accessible gaming. After all, what did the foundation’s software design team do when they received their prototype laptops? They installed <span class="rend-i">Doom.</span></p>

<a name="5.2"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">The Playlist</span></h3>
<p>This list is for the people who want to find out a little more about games. You can only learn so much by reading, so the list gives you an idea of what is worth playing if you want to get up to speed with contemporary games. It’s hardly comprehensive, but it’s nevertheless a wide-ranging survey of the interesting and the significant. Each game on this list represents a different style of gaming, and some of them are far more approachable than others. I’ll try to indicate where that is so. All these games are currently available at retail or as downloads from the Internet. Of course, your best option is to find some obsessive gamers and rifle through their collections—it’ll be much cheaper than buying all this for yourself. The vital tools for this expedition are a PlayStation 2 and a PC, although numerous other consoles are mentioned along the way.</p>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Tetris</span></h4>
<p>The classic <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> experience is on a Game Boy, but there are hundreds of variants, many of which can be downloaded for free from the Internet. <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> represents the core puzzle game against which almost all others are measured. Modern alternatives and variants on the puzzle theme include <span class="rend-i">Lumines</span> on the Sony PSP and <span class="rend-i">Bejeweled</span> on the iPod. <span class="rend-i">Tetris</span> is almost uniformly popular and represents the kind of brain-flexing task that even the nongamers are likely to feel comfortable with.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Robotron</span></h4>
<p>Shoot-’em-ups come in many different forms, but this top-down static screen is about the purest. There are dozens of freeware versions of the classic game available on the Net. Check out <span class="rend-i">Mutant Storm</span> on the PC or <span class="rend-i">Geometry Wars</span> on the Xbox Live Arcade for a more visually sophisticated remix of the classic theme. These kinds of “manic” shooter can be overwhelming for many nongamers, but they also represent one of gaming’s rawest, most stimulating experiences. Master one of these and you can truly be said to be a gamer.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</span></h4>
<p>The side-scrolling platform game has so many incarnations that an entire lifetime could be consumed in playing them. Recent classics include two released on Nintendo’s portable console, the DS. Try <span class="rend-i">Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time,</span> which is just as good as <span class="rend-i">Superstar Saga.</span> To see how Sega attempted to reinvent the 2-D platform game, take a look at <span class="rend-i">Sonic the Hedgehog,</span> which is now available in a bundled conversion of Genesis (Mega Drive) games for the PlayStation 2. It’s worth a look for understanding just how simple mechanics (run, jump) have managed to sustain such popular games for so long.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.4"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Super Mario 64</span></h4>
<p>This Nintendo 64 game remains the best instance of the traditional platform style utilizing 3-D graphics. Groundbreaking and perfectly balanced, it remains one of the greatest instances of the platform game to this day. It is also worth taking a look at <span class="rend-i">Ratchet &amp; Clank</span> on the PlayStation 2 for a more updated experience, although I anticipate that <span class="rend-i">Super Mario Galaxy</span> will have arrived by the time you see these words, (hopefully) reinstating Nintendo as the platform game master.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.5"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Day of the Tentacle</span></h4>
<p>The adventure games, where graphical screens are navigated via a point-and-click mouse interface, represent some of the best and worst of gaming design. When they’re bad, they’re soul-destroying, but when they’re good, they’re sublime. <span class="rend-i">Day of the Tentacle</span>’s time-traveling plot is laugh-out-loud funny and enviably clever. The adventure game doesn’t have a great many worthwhile modern incarnations, but <span class="rend-i">Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit)</span> is an interesting contemporary attempt at adventure-style storytelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.6"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Sims 2</span></h4>
<p>Although imperfect in many ways, this “life sim” from Electronic Arts demonstrates some of the range that games are capable of. Events in <span class="rend-i">The Sims 2</span> are all about personal aspirations and social situations and demand continuous management by the player. Having a job and furnishing a house become entertaining challenges, while the sadistic will just enjoy breaking their Sims’ tiny lives. For a more cartoonish, Japanese take on the life sim, try <span class="rend-i">Animal Crossing</span> on the Nintendo DS or GameCube.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.7"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">SingStar</span></h4>
<p><span class="rend-i">SingStar</span> is karaoke remixed with video games on the PlayStation 2. This is a game that makes sense in a party situation, especially if the tone-deaf people drink too much tasty punch. Worth checking out for the way the singing is rated and rewarded by the game’s visual interface. Also try <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero</span> for rhythm-based rocking out on the PlayStation 2. These are two games that have made the leap from video game pastime to mainstream entertainment.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.8"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Half-Life 2</span></h4>
<p>This is the absolute pinnacle of the first-person action genre on the PC. With astounding visuals, an inspired, brilliant script, and incredibly realistic physics, <span class="rend-i">Half-Life 2</span> demonstrates why the first-person-perspective shooter has become one of the dominant forms of video gaming. It also demonstrates the uncanniness of a protagonist whose adventure is unwaveringly linear and whose only methods of interaction with the world involve ultraviolence and button pressing. The multiplayer is also a fun experience for entry-level online gamers. Using a “gravity gun” to pick up toilets and brutalize your enemies is peculiarly gratifying. Also see <span class="rend-i">Halo</span> on the Xbox for another highly accomplished first-person combat game.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.9"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Elite</span></h4>
<p>It’s tough to recommend <span class="rend-i">Elite</span> to a contemporary audience. The classic space trading game went through many different iterations, all of which look decidedly crude today. It was the first sandbox game and brought us a balance between trade and violence that subsequent games have strained to re-create. It’s nevertheless hard to see whether it would really deliver the same lessons to gamers now that it did in the 1980s and early 1990s. You can grab a playable version of this for the PC. Also in the category of PC-based space exploration, try <span class="rend-i">Freelancer</span> and <span class="rend-i">X3: Reunion.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.10"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span></h4>
<p>They call it the new golf. <span class="rend-i">World of Warcraft</span> boasts millions of subscribers across the world, and it’s easy to see why the tech-savvy Internet generation has bought into this beguilingly beautiful online fantasy. Easy to grasp and laborious to master, it’s a game of wizards and warriors that supports casual dabbling and hard-core obsession. You’ll need an up-to-date PC, a decent broadband connection, and a credit card to play with this oppressively compulsive virtual world.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.11"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Operation Flashpoint</span></h4>
<p>Not all games are fun. Some are terrifying. <span class="rend-i">Operation Flashpoint</span> is one such nightmare experience. It’s a soldier sim in which death looms large. Expect to spend long periods of time lying in a ditch and praying for salvation or watching from the sky, deceased, and following one of the game’s many seagulls. Intensely realistic and brutally unforgiving, <span class="rend-i">Operation Flashpoint</span> has created a hard-core community of virtual soldiery who drill for weeks before playing “actual” games of <span class="rend-i">Operation Flashpoint.</span> A more recent update can be found in the equally scary <span class="rend-i">ArmA: Armed Assault.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.12"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Resident Evil 4</span></h4>
<p>The phrase “survival horror” was coined to describe the first episode in the <span class="rend-i">Resident Evil</span> series. These defining zombie games put gamers in terrifyingly unhelpful situations where mutants and the living dead mean to do harm and where there aren’t enough bullets to stem the tide of the undead. Usually famed for their big frights and desperate situations, the <span class="rend-i">Resident Evil</span> games were updated by the fourth title, which received smash reviews thanks to its nightmarishly grim atmosphere. For an alternative and weird take on survival horror, try the PC title <span class="rend-i">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.13"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Final Fantasy XII</span></h4>
<p>The twelfth <span class="rend-i">Final Fantasy</span> game is a masterpiece of Japanese role-playing design. Accessible and beautiful, it is also abyssally deep, if you care to delve. The unparalleled production values and absurd, epic plot illustrate why Japanese role-playing games have remained so popular over the last twenty years. It’s essentially unparalleled on other game platforms and represents an ongoing quest by Japanese development house Square Enix to create sweeping tales of a mythological magnitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.14"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Oblivion</span></h4>
<p>The PC’s most open-ended single-player role-playing game allows players to approach the defense of their medieval realm against extradimensional demons from a dozen different angles. Ignore the peril of the world and buy a house, or simply spend your hours exploring the vast, detailed terrain. Oblivion is staggeringly beautiful and often overwhelmingly clever, with ample opportunity to accidentally become a vampire. It’s just a shame about the cat people, but their ludicrousness only goes a small way to making this a flawed experience. Also to be found on the Xbox 360, it’s the kind of game that should be played in schools to teach teachers what kids actually get up to these days.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.15"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto 3</span></h4>
<p>Shocking and cartoonishly violent, the <span class="rend-i">Grand Theft Auto</span> games are the grinning miscreant of the gaming world. Available in a number of formats, the game has become most famous on the PlayStation 2, where it caused controversy and delight in equal measure. It’s a stylish game about unlikely criminality, where players steal cars, wreck them, and then steal again, on the way to the top of the tree of their virtual mob.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.16"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">WarioWare, Inc.</span></h4>
<p>Instead of taking one sophisticated game idea and trying to make it last hours, <span class="rend-i">WarioWare, Inc.</span> gives us the minigame. There are dozens of tiny challenges: grab a falling dollar, hit a banana, dance, dodge, shoot, skip, swim. It’s a kind of distillation of possible gaming actions, each one a command, each one to be commanded. It’s against the clock, quick-fire gaming and essential to not taking life too seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.17"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Civilization 4</span></h4>
<p>Raise a civilization up to world dominance over the centuries. This is the scope of the <span class="rend-i">Civilization</span> games, encompassing all of history, from the invention of the wheel to nuclear war. You struggle to control the world, asserting the diplomatic, economic, and military muscle of your culture across the ages. It’s a beautiful vision and one of the most sophisticated strategy games imaginable.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.18"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Streetfighter 2</span></h4>
<p>Like many of the games on this list, fighting games seem obscure and unapproachable to outsiders. They owe this heritage to <span class="rend-i">Streetfighter 2,</span> the side-scrolling, character-based combat duel that captured minds across the 1990s. The game defined how fighting games demanded that players appropriate their complicated methods for genuine mastery. It’s often a hard lesson to learn, despite the initial success of random “button mashing.” For a streamlined, nonbloated modern variant, try <span class="rend-i">Virtua Fighter 5</span> on the PlayStation 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.19"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Prince of Persia</span></h4>
<p>This kind of platform adventure game was most famously delivered by Lara Croft in the form of <span class="rend-i">Tomb Raider.</span> Nevertheless, I think <span class="rend-i">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</span> offers an altogether more satisfying experience. The best of the <span class="rend-i">Tomb Raider</span> games are getting old now, and the prince is doing everything Lara did, with an added (and joyous) time-rewinding function.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.20"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Mario Kart</span></h4>
<p>Nintendo’s cartoon racing game is the polar opposite of simulation racing games. A world of glowing mushrooms and vibrant colors, its Super Nintendo version was the first game I truly obsessed over. It’s a game that rewards skill but delights beginners. The most recent incarnation is on the handheld Nintendo DS, but I recommend the original, classic version if you can get hold of a Super Nintendo.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.21"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Wipeout 2097</span></h4>
<p>This entry reveals a bit more about my personal tastes in gaming. The “future racer” genre has always been problematic and has never quite found itself a mature instance. The best of the lot was <span class="rend-i">Wipeout 2097</span> on the original PlayStation, which matched ease of play with the potential to master tricky courses at mind-numbing speeds on the higher difficulty settings. <span class="rend-i">Wipeout 2097</span> is also interesting because it represented a major shift in marketing tactics for video game companies. Sony deliberately tied popular electronic and dance music into the release of the game, forever associating the game with the dance music culture of its era.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.22"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</span></h4>
<p>The Nintendo Wii was fortunate to launch itself onto the market with a truly great game. While the fairies-in-fantasyland theme grates with some players, it’s hard to argue against the classic, open-ended delights of the <span class="rend-i">Zelda</span> games, of which <span class="rend-i">Twilight Princess</span> is arguably the finest incarnation. Transform into a wolf, ride a horse, go fishing, and save the world: this is gaming as it was always meant to be, I suspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.23"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">We Love Katamari</span></h4>
<p>You roll a ball that picks things up: this is the principle of the katamari. It doesn’t matter what the thing is; if your katamari ball is big enough, things will stick to it. And so you roll up nuts and bolts, matchboxes and cups; then cats and dogs, furniture, streetlamps, cars, houses, people; and eventually skyscrapers, mountains, coastlines, and the very sky itself. <span class="rend-i">We Love Katamari</span> is unflinchingly quirky, slightly irritating, and utterly charming—one of the most creative PlayStation 2 games.</p>
</div>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<a name="5.2.24"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Shadow of the Colossus</span></h4>
<p>This game of giant slaying has been lauded thanks to its exquisite presentation and artistic sensibility. Each of the giants is a vast, walking puzzle that must be scaled and murdered for you to be able to continue. There’s something deeply sad about the deaths of the gothic leviathans, and the game’s beauty is partly in delivering these mixed emotions while at the same time awing and terrifying the player. <span class="rend-i">Shadow of the Colossus</span> was one of the masterpieces that arrived at the end of the PlayStation 2 era.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, I wrote <span class="rend-i">This Gaming Life</span> while playing six different games.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">EVE Online</span> on the PC. As should be obvious from so much of the content of <span class="rend-i">This Gaming Life, EVE Online</span> is a long-term interest of mine. I cannot, however, recommend it to someone who has not previously dabbled in gaming. <span class="rend-i">EVE</span> is almost impenetrable to beginners and offers very little reward for casual play. The game can be downloaded from www.eve-online.com, but make sure your PC meets the minimum requirements to play. The game also requires that you buy time in the form of a credit card payment. Following the tutorial and getting help from other players is essential to deciphering this largely arcane and unhelpful universe.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">Okami</span> on the PlayStation 2. Perfectly crafted and with a unique art style, <span class="rend-i">Okami</span> is an attempt to create a game based on feudal Japanese influences. Traditional woodcut prints on parchment, calligraphy, and old-fashioned watercolor define much of the visual style, while the story is built around Japanese polytheistic religion. The game itself is an open-ended adventure reminiscent of games like <span class="rend-i">The Legend of Zelda.</span> I found <span class="rend-i">Okami</span> to be enormously soothing—something that I don’t usually expect from games.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">Guitar Hero</span> on the PlayStation 2. A video game celebration of rocking out, this is one of the finest pieces of game design in recent memory and utterly compulsive as a result. The game requires the custom-built plastic guitar controller and a sense of humor to play. A vague sense of rhythm also helps.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span> on the PC. This is like a social venue and safari through human weirdness. I’ll occasionally drop by to go shopping (I bought a clockwork blunderbuss, a cannon, a new robot suit, and a selection of alien flora just last night) or visit the building projects of acquaintances to hang out and discuss games. Other times I’ll just pick a direction and fly, traveling across sex shop bazaars, gaming parlors, acres of private housing, and sinister towers in the sky. Using this game for virtual tourism is a great way to frighten yourself, especially when you end up in the parlor of one of <span class="rend-i">Second Life</span>’s many outrageous fetishists.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</span> on the PC. It’s fortunate that this horror masterpiece showed up toward the end of writing this manuscript, or there might have been dire consequences for certain deadlines. Based on a remixed version of the Chernobyl zone, Tarkovski’s film <span class="rend-i">Stalker,</span> and the original <span class="rend-i">Roadside Picnic</span> novel, this is a masterwork of modern mythology. The Ukrainian development team have fictionalized the disaster on their doorstep to make something beautiful and utterly terrifying. It’s a gamer’s game, refusing to pull punches and demanding absolute attention. I would say it is a dream game, but it’s actually more like a nightmare.</p>
<p>&gt; <span class="rend-i">Wii Sports</span> on the Nintendo Wii. Watching my girlfriend use the Nintendo Wii’s motion-sensitive controllers to pummel virtual opponents in <span class="rend-i">Wii Boxing</span> has made me better behaved than ever before. Meanwhile, I prefer some bowling and a beer.</p>
